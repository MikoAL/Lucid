Mom told me yesterday that I should probably record what I have been doing for the past year, since I'll have to present my process to the school.
yeah I should probably have done that from the start. Whatever, it's never too late to start.

To summarize my last year of progress...
I spent a year grasping basic concepts.
I'm not even joking, I think I have spent a year just barely understanding wtf this field is about.

For today's progress, I have been trying to familirize myself with textual, for both a dashboard/ui for this project, also for any future python projects.

I actually figured out how to use Textual! It took me an entire Saturday, but I figured it out.
