      "I can't take any credit for this, it's straight from Betty Crocker. Except for the last step, which is based on my own experimentation and also includes the bakery rule: Never cut your own cake. We all know that rule, right? Any baker worth their salt will tell you that a freshly baked cake should never, ever be cut by the person who baked it. Instead, a cake is always cut and then immediately handed off to someone else, preferably someone who's currently starving and has nothing else to eat. This person then hands the cut cake back to the baker, who will then send it on its way to its final destination. The cake may pass through many sets of hands before it reaches its end point. It is the magic of the bakery. Or a lie. Depends on your perspective, I guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why I like this cake: it's rich, it's chocolate-y, and it's almost health food. The chocolate instant pudding gives it a deep, velvety texture. The brewed coffee deepens the chocolate flavor even further and somehow makes the cake taste less like cake and more like a dessert you'd get at a really fancy bakery. I don't know if this is true, but it's a lovely little lie I tell myself every time I bake this cake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, this cake is perfect for sharing, which is wonderful for two reasons: one, because it's such a rich and intense dessert, sharing means that you won't have to try to eat the whole thing yourself, and two, because it's very hard to feel guilty about eating something you made when you also shared it with people who will love it as much as you do. It's a win-win situation for everyone involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if you just can't bring yourself to share, there's always the modified recipe that calls for baking only one cake. This recipe can be used in any situation where the bakery rule applies. And yes, that means it can also be used for baking two cakes, or twelve cakes, or however many cakes you want to bake. As with all good bakery rules, it's infinitely flexible and will bend to your will. And then, if you've baked multiple cakes and still can't decide which one you want to eat, well, I think you'll find that life has a way of making those choices for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy the cake! And please share your own favorite cake recipes in the comments below. I'm always looking for a new bakery rule to experiment with.\n",
