## Disclamer

This project is a work in progress and is not yet ready for use.
All code in the repository is not usable right out of the box and will require modification to work.

***It is not recommended to use any of the code in this repository for any purpose.***

It is simply a collection of ideas and concepts that are being worked on and are not yet ready for use.

If you want to create a similar but functional project, it is recommended to start with the [GlaDOS](https://github.com/dnhkng/GlaDOS) repo by [dnhkng](https://github.com/dnhkng).

## Project Goal

Create a Chatbot that you can speak and listen to for a long time and still have the bot reasonably pass as a human.
