      "Hello! Do you like rock music?\n",
      "Hi! I love rock music and it has been for a while now. I think since the 60s.\n",
      "Yeah, it's definitely a classic and great genre. White snake has had over 50 members through it's history. That's crazy!\n",
      "I know. The list has its own wikipedia page.\n",
      "I wonder why so many people ended up leaving/joining the band. Do you know if they were just a specific position switching out, like a guitarist?  \n",
      "I guess they may not have get used to that life style. Did you know that a song became popular because a DJ didn't reveal the band name. Don't remember where it was, but still incredible. \n",
      "That's pretty interesting. Sonic the hedgehog was supposed to have been in a rock band. I wonder how that would have worked out. \n",
      "Hahaha. Honestly, I have no idea. I also heard that he have a blond haired human girlfriend named Madonna.\n",
      "That's really strange. I'm glad he just stayed a video game character. Viktor tsoi kept his job in a boiler room after becoming the biggest rock star in russian history. \n",
      "russian already sounds like rock anyways. Rock is kind of interesting, even Oklahoma has a state rock song.\n",
      "That's pretty cool. Did you know the man who assassinated Abraham Lincoln was named after the man who assassinated Julius Caesar? \n",
      "too much concidence. Abraham Lincoln has a unusual voice. Do you know how he sounded?\n",
      "Apparently he had a high pitch voice, I never would have guessed that! I always imagined him as having a deep voice for some reason.\n",
      "Me too. The say that he used to keep his important documents in his hat. That's kind of funny. Now we know why the hat was so high. hahaha\n",
      "He had so many secrets in there, lol! Lincoln created the secret service the morning he was shot. That seems suspicious. \n",
      "I think so too.  Abraham Lincoln was the first republican as well.\n",
      "That's interesting! He started a long line of bearded republicans! \n",
      "he had done good things as well. He preserved the Union and abolished  slavery.\n",
      "Yeah, he was very noble and good hearted. He was also a lawyer before becoming a politician! \n",
      "I wonder if he was a good lawyer.  I heard he also modernized the economy.\n",
      "Yes,he was a  very good president! Well, it was nice chatting with you! \n",
      "See you next time\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you today? Do you like rock music?\n",
      "Hi! I do like rock music, I like a little bit of everything. \n",
      "The state rock song of Oklahoma is \"Do You Realize?\" by the Flaming Lips. I didn't know that states had rock songs. \n",
      "Especially a lot of midwestern states seem to have songs attached to them. I was reading that Whitesnake has had over 50 members in its history. They must not be fun to work with.\n",
      "I guess not. Maybe it's band to put on your resume, then move on. I don't know how much they tour. It could be a tough gig.\n",
      "Probably some overdosed. I read that a hanson song became the most requested track on a chicago station not because people liked it, but the station created an air of mystery about it by not telling people who sang the song.\n",
      "That was very smart of them. Get new listeners, more advertising. Probably a boy band is not what most listeners were looking for.\n",
      "I heard the sonic the hedgehog character was supposed to be a member of a rock band, and had a girlfriend named madonna, but I didn't hear the whole story. Do you know?\n",
      "Sonic in a rock band? I guess he has the haircut for it. He could probably have joined Whitesnake. \n",
      "Oh yeah, that would have been good. Are you interested in history? I was reading about Lincoln. He had a high pitched voice, I guess.\n",
      "That's funny because he was very tall. He kept his important documents inside his hat. I guess that hat was pretty big.\n",
      "You know, I always mean to do some research to see if he maybe had some kind of genetic disorder. He was so tall, and had such strange bone structure. Especially hearing about his weird voice now, I'm even more curious.\n",
      "He had a pretty big beard, so I would have expected a deep voice. He was an unusual guy that met a tragic end.\n",
      "I would expect deep voice too. Did you know he created the secret service the very morning he was assassinated? Ironic.\n",
      "I guess he recognized that he was at tremendous risk because of the war and his treatment of slaves. I don't know if the secret service could have saved him.\n",
      "No, I'm sure they couldn't have. John Wilkes Booth father was named after the man that assassinated julius caesar. What a strange story all around. \n",
      "Yeah, lots of weird connections. Lincoln had a secretary named Kennedy. JFK had a secretary named Lincoln. It's kismet.\n",
      "I've never heard that. Those types of coincidences are always interesting to me. \n",
      "We can always find connections if we look hard enough. For example, Lance Henriksen and Bill Paxton are the only two actors to face off against a terminator, an alien and a predator. Connections abound.\n",
      "Oh sure, I guess Bender from futurama and the terminator both have the same cpu. \n",
      "that's great! Bender is savage. He really could be a terminator. Never quite get the salary for Arnold though.\n",
      "I can't believe he gets paid so much. He only said like 100 words in Terminator. \n",
      "His physique is the key. Plus that Austrian accent. \n",
      "Its been nice talking to you!\n",
      "Great chat! Have a good day!\n",
      "I You have a great day too\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi! So do you like music? I love rock music and well many other genre's.\n",
      "Yes, I'm the same! I love music....I didn 't know the band Whitesnake has had over 50 members over time?Thinking the lead singer stayed the same, not sure?\n",
      "That is something I read too, I do believe the lead singer is the same. There was so much great rock music back in the day!\n",
      "Oh, I know, Decades. There was so much and people today have no idea how great alot of it was!!\n",
      "Very true! I really love the electric guitars in Rock, it's all good. I got to see the best bands in concert that's for sure lol\n",
      "You sound like me! I have been to so many concerts and have bought so much music over the years. I have  alot to refer back to. Do you have favorite bands?\n",
      "That's awesome! My favorites to name a couple would be Pink Floyd and Aerosmith...so many more! How about you?\n",
      "Yes, I have seen Pink Floyd a few times and Aerosmith every time they came to our state. I heard they were going to do Las Vegas for awhile. I go back to Elvis, Beatles, all the 70 and 80  90 bands. I have tickets to the Who this year and Bryan Adams so far! lol\n",
      "Haha! That's awesome, you sound like me, I kept memento's along the as well, In the 90s I went to see Candlebox and the drummer came up to me and handed me his drum stick, and I have met many, I wish I could have seen Ozzy but never did which is a bummer.\n",
      "I know, I would have like that too! Very cool. Its hard to get the up front seats! lol, While in Texas I saw Rod Stewart and manage to get two balls that night. I went this last year and had second level seat on the side and one of his guys came up to me and a friend and gave us front row center! we were shocked!! Very happy that night!! lol\n",
      "Wow, that is amazing! You have been to as many concerts or more than I have lol, I just love seeing them so I will pay for up front if I can, I got real close to the Cult and Queensryche, and at a Van Halen concert I saw some famous people next to me.\n",
      "Really, that's so interesting! One of favorites is Led Zepp Lucky to see them in 77, and then again When Robert Plant and Jimmy Page did a tour together and had close seats. Very Cool. Would have been nice to see them in 2007 in the UK. I think those tickets sold out in minutes at a very high price!\n",
      "You got to see Led Zeppelin?? Wow, that is awesome. I love those guys! Yes, not always easy to get tickets they sell fast! Especially these days. But just like music we got to see all the great movies too, did you ever see the terminator?\n",
      "Yes, I enjoyed it. I can't believe he only made $75,000 in the first one!!\n",
      "I know! But he did make 15 million in the 2nd one so that's great! He only had to speak 18 lines in the Terminator and less than 100 words lol...I would take 75 grand for that!\n",
      "lol, I know....Have you been to the Terminator ride at Universal?\n",
      "No I haven't but I did go to Universal studios back in the late 90s and went to the Terminator 3D show, wow I was blown away!! How was the ride?\n",
      "Yes, that's the one I mean! Where an actor comes out and rides all around on a motorcycle with the gun!! Alot of fun!! The 3D movie was great!!\n",
      "Yes! That is it, but it seemed like you were on a crazy ride lol. That franchise is worth 3 billion dollars that's pretty amazing for older movies.\n",
      "Yes, I agree. A fun thing to know about Abraham Lincoln, he kept important papers in his hat and his had a high pitched voice! Who knew?\n",
      "Really? That's odd about his voice, he looks so rough lol. He was a great president though. And how does it happen that he gets assasinated just after creating the secret service, wow.\n",
      "I didn't know that either, surprised me. The same morning!  In the films about him he always has a deep voice!! Great chat!!\n",
      "I know, very bad for the poor guy. Thanks for the chat! I need to go listen to some good Rock music and watch the Terminator now lol! Bye!!\n",

      "Hello.  Do you like Rock Music?  Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as \"rock and roll\" in the US in the early 1950s and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later in the UK as well as the US.\n",
      "Yes I do like rock music! I especially like that a lot of rock artists seem to be down to earth, like even after becoming the biggest rock star in Russian history, Viktor Tsoi kept his job in the boiler room.\n",
      "That's too funny.  Did you know that the state rock song of Oklahoma is \"do you realize?\" by the Flaming Lips?\n",
      "I didn't know states could have state rock songs! I wonder if Illinois' is that song that became the most requested track on that Chicago alt-rock radio station.\n",
      "That could be.  You mean that Hanson song? Yes, the DJ didn't reveal who sang the song or what band did and so everyone wanted to hear who did it, probably.\n",
      "Yes that's the one! I think it's interesting that no one knew the band/its members. On the other hand you have bands like Whitesnake, which has had over 50 members throughout it's history.\n",
      "Whitesnake was one of my favorite bands.  I didn't know that they had so many members that they had their own Wikipedia page about it though. Funny.\n",
      "I also saw recently on Wikipedia that Sonic the hedgehog was actually supposed to be a member of a rockband, with a blond human girlfriend named Madonna!\n",
      "Right, very funny. I heard that one, too.  Rock music is actually very interesting, it typically has a 4/4 time signiture using a verse-chorus form but it has become extremely diverse.  Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or even political. \n",
      "Yeah rock music is definitely fascinating. I like that it draws from a lot of other genres I enjoy, like jazz, classical, blues and folk music.\n",
      "Yes, I like that too.  Did you see the Terminator?  Did you know that Arnold Schwarzenegger speaks only 18 lines in \"The Terminator\" and less than 100 words in total?  I didn't realize that before.\n",
      "I never knew that! I wonder if he had a bigger role in Terminator 2, because I know his pay got significantly bumped from $75k for the first movie to $15 million with the second.\n",
      "It could be.  I remember that The Terminator movies encompassed a series of films, comics, novels and additional media concerning battles between Skynet's synthetic intelligent machine network and John Connor's Resistance forces and the rest of the human race.\n",
      "Yeah I'm sure a lot of people appreciated the unique concept of the films. That's probably why as of 2010, the franchise has made over $8 billion in revenue!\n",
      "Yes, I agree.  Also, scientists developed a real-life T1000 polymer, the world's first self-fixing plastic call the terminator.\n",
      "That's crazy! It's certainly a unique material. Although I think the Terminator itself isn't the most unique robot; Bender from Futurama shares the same processor, the 6502 cpu.\n",
      "Yes, and that's same CPU used in Atari 2600, NES, and C64 computer models.  That is amazing.\n",
      "On a separate note, are you interested in Abraham Lincoln at all? I find it fascinating the father of his assassinator was named after the killer of Julius Caesar.\n",
      "Yes, the whole Abraham Lincoln saga is strange, in my opinion.  In fact, ironically, Abe created the Secret Service the morning he was fatally shot by John Wilkes Booth.\n",
      "That's surprising! I wonder if things would have been different if he had created it sooner. I also wonder if his killer found any important documents in Lincoln's hat, where he kept them.\n",
      "Yes, the answers to which we will probably never find out.  Nice chatting with you, have a good one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi how are you doing over there? \n",
      "Fine. Are you a movie fan?\n",
      "yes, i am a movie fan. I think that there are many fine movies done by Tom Cruise.\n",
      "Loved him in Rainman and Jerry McGuire. What do you think of his Mission Impossible films?\n",
      "he has done a great job finding co-stars that round out the cast. the stories are strong too.\n",
      "Can't say. Only saw the 1st film. Heard that Angela Bassett is in the latest film. Like her a lot. Which costars are your favorites?\n",
      "i like simon pegg. ving rhames is also good. there are a couple of others that i forgot.\n",
      "What do you think about Cruise still doing his own stunts at age 56\n",
      "I think that he is taking a risk that could stop production and cost a lot of money. i see no need for it.\n",
      "I agree. Seems odd that Cruise, who has won a Golden Globe Award, never won an Oscar for best actor. He's starred in so many films!\n",
      "he doesnt do the right kind of films, or doesnt play the right role. in rain man, he did not have a disease. in born on the fourth of july, he probably had a chance but the other films were good.\n",
      "The film I felt he really earned an Oscar for was Jerry Maguire. So memorable. Do you agree?\n",
      "he did a great job, but it was a date movie about sports and the academy likes middle brow stuff. weighty material about war and disease.\n",
      "Date and sports movie, yes, but I'll never forget it. Did you know the M. I. series started in 1996?\n",
      "there was a tv show before that. the films started in the 90s, i know.\n",
      "The 60's TV show was a bit silly, but that was part of its appeal; that, and the tape-recorded mission messages... Ever see a re-run?\n",
      "yeah, probably a couple. it was 60s TV, a bit campy, but what are you going to do? it was the time of odd soundtracks and weirder clothes.\n",
      "Yes! M. I. films don't seem to take themselves too seriously, I'\n",
      "which is good. i mean, come on, its a spy show with silly masks and stuff. have fun! its hollywood! escape for two hours.\n",
      "Agreed. Do you plan to see the latest installment: M. I - Fallout?\n",
      "I would like to. it got good reviews. Anyway, great chat!\n",
      "Enjoy your Tom Cruise movie! Cheers!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a tom Cruise fan? \n",
      "Indeed i think he's a great actor. How about you?\n",
      "I think he is pretty good. He hasn't won many awards though. Did you know that? \n",
      "I did not, seems like he would have. Did you like M.I. Fallout?\n",
      "I haven't seen it. Is that the latest one? \n",
      "Yeah i give it a 7 but i will still go and see the next one, lol! \n",
      "Yeah, I'll eventually see it. He's pretty entertaining to be honest. I liked him in Risky Business. Hilarious. \n",
      "Oh my God you taking me back now. You k now he made 75Million from one movie? \n",
      "No, I didn't know that. He also built an underground bunker. \n",
      "Underground bunker! Does he know something we don't, lol. Do you know he vandalized the worlds tallest building?\n",
      "He's probably losing it a bit to be honest. It wouldn't surprise me. \n",
      "Yeah apparently back in 2010 he sketched Katie Holmes name into a spire.\n",
      "Hmmm, is that true? It wouldn't surprise me one bit. \n",
      "Apparently he does his own stunts, he hung of a airplane at 5,000 feet.\n",
      "Yeah, that will do the trick. What about inception, have you seen it? \n",
      "That is one of my all time favorite movies. You?\n",
      "I saw it. I got confused throughout it. I didn't realize they tried to cast Will Smith. Did you? \n",
      "I did not glad they didn't I like leo. It took Nolan 10 years to write inception. \n",
      "Wow, that is a long time to take to write a script. Well, nice chatting with you!\n",
      "I know but it grossed 828 Million world wide, the 4th highest in 2010.\n",
      "Nice, well, take it easy. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey! Have you heard of Tom Cruise?  What do you think about him doing his own stunts?\n",
      "I think that he is a great actor, Ive always thought he had mad skills and think its kind of dangerous him doing his own stunts\n",
      "I totally agree with you but on the other hand, it is kind of cool and makes the movies more realistic.  Although Mission Impossible-Fallout is pretty far out there as far as realism goes.\n",
      "I agree, movies are becoming unrealistic like that, they have become too scaled, irrational.\n",
      "I know,  take the Mission Impossible movie for example.  Tom Cruise does a motorcycle chase in Paris.  That's not bad but what is is that there's hardly anyone on the road.  Totally fake.\n",
      "Yeah totally fake indeed, What I do like about the movie is the different locations, Paris, London, Kashmir.\n",
      "That is nice.  It's all good to look at. Even Tom Cruise is, and he's 56 years old!\n",
      "He doesnt look like he has 56 years! I heard he made 75000000 from Mission Impossible 3\n",
      "That's way too much money!  He gets away with so much stuff, like scratching katie holmes's name in the world's tallest building.\n",
      "Wow I wonder why he would do that, you know he spent two years learning swordplay and also japanese for a movie.\n",
      "That's good and shows some depth.  On the other hand, he did spend $10 million  on a bunker that's underground to protect himself from aliens!\n",
      "That seems a bit paranoid, speaking of movies did you watch Inception?\n",
      "I don't think I have. Is it any good?\n",
      "Its actually pretty good, its directed by Christopher Nolan, the movie had $828 million in sales.\n",
      "Wow! Isn't that the movie with Leonardo DiCaprio in it?\n",
      "Yea Leonardo is the leading actor, you know two famous actors rejected the part, I bet they regretted that.\n",
      "Really?  Which ones did that?  Seems like you always hear of big names rejecting parts and then finding out the movies do fantastic.\n",
      "Will Smith and Brat Pitt are the ones that declined the role, and yeah I bet they though it was going to be a lousy movie.\n",
      "They are very different that Leonardo. I wonder how the movie would have been with one of them instead.  Tom Cruise has a wide range of movies from Top Gun to Rain Man though. I guess he could do any role.\n",
      "I bet it would be different for sure, I liked Top Gun I think it was a great movie.\n",
      "It was a good movie. I did see that one way back in the day!  You got me thinking about that movie, Inception, though.  Wasn't Elon Musk's wife in it?\n",
      "Yeah she was in it, I though she was pretty good, you should definitely watch it, great movie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good afternoon!  A you a fan of movies?\n",
      "Yes.  Are you a fan of the Mission Impossible film series? Tom Cruise made $75m from Mission Impossible III alone!\n",
      "I'm not that much of a fan of TC movies as i used to be - maybe because they're all pretty much the same as with MI series.  I do like his early work\n",
      "Yes I'm not either.  Must be nice to make that kind of money.\n",
      "You said it - so much money to make essentially the same movie over and over and over... Cocktail is probably my favorite movie of his, and that was decades ago!\n",
      "They are repetitive. I didn't care for \"the Last Samurai\" but I did like \"Top Gun.\"\n",
      "Didn't see the Last Samurai.  I heard they were making a TG sequel - wonder how that will be received? \n",
      "Probably not as well as it was during the Reagan admin. I didn't realize Elon Musk was in Inception. \n",
      "I thought I heard about Elon Musk in Inception, but I cannot recall what character he played?  I've seen that movie several times to try to understand it!\n",
      "No kidding! It was sooooo hard to follow.  It took 10 years for Nolan to write something that confusing. \n",
      "Talk about a passion project!  Probably needed multiple flow charts to keep track of everything....\n",
      "Yeah!  I was wrong... It was Musk's wife that was in Inception.  I have no idea what she looks like.  Nolan got his son in the movie too.\n",
      "Aha!  I was just racking my brain about EM in that movie!  And now I need to figure out who his wife is!!!\n",
      "Sorry :)  I will say Cruise is dedicated.  He spent two years learning Japanese for the Last Samurai. \n",
      "I think the concept of the Last Samurai is fascinating, because of what it implies - their only purpose in life is to protect their Master and if they fail to do that they must kill themselves.  In the rare occasion they are without a Master due to other circumstances, they go Ronin (another great movie) and basically become a mercenary.  \n",
      "It's kind of true for Cruise in that he spent $10M for a bunker to protect himself from aliens.  I wonder if that's true.  I know he's a little wacky but that seems a bit too much.\n",
      "That probably has more do with him being a Scientologist than anything - and the most popular member of that religion to boot!   \n",
      "Yeah I heard of that.  He did etch Katie Holmes name on the top of the Burj Khalifa building.  That's wacky so...\n",
      "All this TC trivia is a little creepy, feeling like I need a shower!  I almost forgot about the Katie Holmes marriage and kid....  He sure has led a full life\n",
      "Yes, but I too am having to rethink him.  I really did like him in Risky Business back in the day.  He actually does his stunts like hanging from a plane at 5,000 feet in the newest MI. \n",
      "Risky Business was great, I was a huge Rebbeca De Mornay fan when I was younger...\n",
      "Yeah, she is/was hot. Thanks for the chat.  You were excellent!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "HI, how are you?\n",
      "Hello, did uou watch Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom? what are your thoughs on this movie\n",
      "I did not see it. Did you?\n",
      "I did, I  liked it but there are some absurb scenes that didnt make sense at all\n",
      "Was that the second one with Chris Pratt? I saw the first one, not the second one.\n",
      "Yeah exactly thats the one with Pratt, he is a velociraptor trainer in the movie\n",
      "I think I only saw that becuase my wife has a crush on him. I think he may have been shirtless on the trailer so my wife was all in on the movie. Did you like it?\n",
      "I liked it, I thought it was a nice movie although many parts were unreal like when the volcano explodes and he suddenly can move again.\n",
      "Ill check it out when it comes to Netflix... I found it odd that the dinosaurs were only on the screen for 15 minutes. Must have had a small CGI budget.\n",
      "Yeah, Im guessing its a expensive production overall, theres a cool fact and theyy used elephant roars for the t-rex\n",
      "Really? I recently heard that dinosaurs had really small and meek roars. Not at all like what is projected at movies or on TV.\n",
      "Maybe they projected it this way so that they would sound scarier, also velociraptors were smaller than projected in movies.\n",
      "Did you see that the park ride cost more than the movie to make?\n",
      "No I actually didnt see that, os are you a dinarour fan? I used to love them when I was a little kid\n",
      "I really did not get into them. That and space were never really that intriguing to me. What about you?\n",
      "I like them, I  think there are many interesting facts about them I heard scientists recovered a sample of tissue and blood vessels from a T-Rex\n",
      "Really! Wow, I wonder if they are going to try and clone it. Seems like something we would do and then immediately regret...\n",
      "Yeah, Jurassic Park should work as a warning lol, that would definetely chage things.\n",
      "I can see them screwing it up and having some sad creature that only semi-resembles a dinosaur. It would be an ethical dilema for sure.\n",
      "For sure, it would generate a lot of dispute so anyway do you like how Chris Pratt acts?\n",
      "I do know some like he worked at Bubba Gump. Nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Did you watch Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom?\n",
      "No, but I have heard some about it.  At least the woman is not running in high heels in this movie!\n",
      "there are 7 scense that dont make sense at all\n",
      "I remember talk about one.. Chris Pratt is paralyzed by a tranquilizer dart but then crawls away from molten lava using his paralyzed limbs.  Ha!\n",
      "Yeah and also the computer parts of the old park still function that is also an absurd thing\n",
      "Someone was amused by Chris Pratt doing a somersault through the open mouth of a T-Rex.\n",
      "Is that the scene in which Chris Pratt defies physics? because thats also another ridiculous scene\n",
      "Apparently he became an athlete after being a house builder.  That seemed strange.\n",
      "It does seem strange and also how in the middle of the film Pratt developed Nave SEAL skills in a magical way\n",
      "One reviewer also said that the movie managed to make dinosaurs boring which is hard to do.\n",
      "I didnt really like the movie, the old Jurassic Park movies were so much better many inconsistensies I do like the leading actor\n",
      "Apparently the dinosaurs only appear for 15 minutes in the film.  Universal built a ride that cost them more than the film did.\n",
      "Really? how much did it cost?\n",
      "The ride cost $110 million while the film was $63 million.\n",
      "Oh seems like they should spend more in the movie and add more dinasour time in it. Did you hear about the joke Chris Pratt made about the franchise\n",
      "I think people do get bored looking at too much dinosaur time.  The people are more interesting.  What was Pratt's joke?\n",
      "He joked about getting the part in 2010 for Jurassic Park 4\n",
      "Wow!  That is like a premonition.  I guess I will make a joke about winning Power Ball.  I guess you know that the raptors are not computer generated, but are people in dinosaur suits?\n",
      "Really? they fooled me, I thought that was the computer, it sure takes a long time to render one frame of the T-Rex dinasaur\n",
      "I suppose that is because of the raindrops and water dripping from T-Rex.\n",
      "The detail is impressive I guess thats why it takes so long to render them \n",
      "I think so too.  Well, my wife is asking me to go get some whipping cream for some chicken soup so I am going to wrap it up.  Nice chatting with you.\n",
      "You wouldnt want to upset the wife! hope you have a nice meal, thanks for the chat and the cool facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you seen Jurassic world? \n",
      "I tried watching it but it had some many \"believability\" problems from talking to velociraptors to costuming. \n",
      "Yeah it was a bit cheesy. I do like chris pratt though. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, he's cool even though his sudden Navy SEAL special forces transition was a bit much.\n",
      "the dinosaurs only appears for 15 minutes\n",
      "Really?  Seemed like much the same with the predictable humans over dinos where that usually turns out bad. \n",
      "well it only grossed 63 million and it cost 110 million.\n",
      "Maybe deviating from CGI had a price.  There were actually people inside of suits for the dinos.\n",
      "No CGI wow what a rip off. apparently Pratt joked about the lead role. \n",
      "No surprise there. :)  He's come a long way from waiting tables at 19.  At a Bubba Gump nonetheless...\n",
      "That's for sure, you know it took 6 hours to render one frame of soaked rained t-rex.\n",
      "I'm not sure I have the patience for that. Did you know 40% of Americans think humans an dinos lived at the same time?\n",
      "Wow too funny! James Gun wanted Pratt for Guardians so bad he was willing to CGI him a six pack.\n",
      "Hee.  He could just exercise.    Wonder if Pratt made a similar deal when Spielberg casted with in JP 4. \n",
      "Yeah probably. Did you know that all 50 states have Dino Fossil in them.\n",
      "Pretty cool.  Maybe that's why Canada came up with a glow in the dark dino coin. \n",
      "Do you know who they were considering for the role in guardians before pratt?\n",
      "The guy that plays Dennis on Sunny in Philly? \n",
      "I never watch the show, do you think he would have done a better job?\n",
      "No.  I do watch the show and it's funny but I can see him doing better. \n",
      "The original JP's were much better in my opinion. \n",
      "It looks that way given the dinos were only there 15 minutes.  I also think people are a little burned out on JP. \n",
      "Yup. well it was nice chatting with you have a good day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "Hello. So I've been reading about Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, and Chris Pratt. I haven't seen Fallen Kingdom yet though.\n",
      "Me too. Is there anything that stood out for you?\n",
      "About the movie, a little, but I became really interested in the last paragraph when it talked about how scientists expressed the genes of chickens and they grew teeth.\n",
      "I was a little surprised the dinosaurs were only on film for 15 minutes. Seems like that is not a lot...\n",
      "They did a good job of really building suspense so when they WERE on screen, it was a big deal!\n",
      "That's true. Really good point. I loved the Michael Crichton book so I never saw the original Jurassic Park in fear that it would ruin the book. Still haven't seen it...\n",
      "I think aside from my husband's obsession, the movies feel a bit dated, the older ones do, so it might be harder to see. \n",
      "I did see the first one with Chris Pratt but that is all I have seen. I think I saw it because my wife may or may not have a thing for Chris Pratt, post-parks and rec when he got ripped.\n",
      "That's true, he became really hot lol. He was pretty good in Parks and Rec, but as Star Lord he just rocks it. He does really good in silly movies.\n",
      "Agreed. Can you imagine him waiting on you at Bubba Gump, and then seeing him on tv a few weeks later?\n",
      "That would be hilarious. Like hey honey, wasn't that our waiter? Oh heck, he's made it to tv! haha.\n",
      "He wouldn't be the most incredible actor who made the jump. He is talented at those roles though...\n",
      "Yeah. I haven't seen him in any of the other movies listed like \"her\" or \"delivery man\" but the few I have seen, he's pretty funny and sells the role.\n",
      "The generic role... \"delivery man\" that's funny. I really liked parks and rec. Did you?\n",
      "Yeah, though I never finished it because I got tired of how aggressive Leslie Knope was after a while. And it felt weird that her dream became the focus, and Ben's just got crushed. Kinda opposite of Feminism.\n",
      "HA! Yeah, as someone who works in parks and rec, it got really corny, really fast but I was so impressed with the writing. It was so good.\n",
      "The writing was great, yes. Chris Pratt and April made the show for me. Happy dog and angry cat!\n",
      "HA! I always liked the \"Damnit Jerry!\" when Jerry would not do anything wrong. That poor guy.\n",
      "I saw him in another Tv show recently, for a one time part, uhh Brooklyn 99, he was funny for a one time bit. Poor guy indeed.\n",
      "I must have missed that one. I love 99. That's another well written show. Almost got cancelled so I am glad NBC picked it up.\n",
      "Yes I've been watching it on Hulu episode by episode as it continues! \n",
      "Nice chatting with you!\n",

      "Did You hear that clowns copyright their makeup designs on eggshells ?\n",
      "I never heard that one.  Also, American makeup companies have resumed animal testing so they can sell products in China.\n",
      "How is animal testing related to selling products in China ? Sorry, I don't get that one...\n",
      "not sure but maybe it's required to happen before china will buy?  keanu gave $80 million of his $114 million matrix salary to special effects and makeup staff\n",
      "I wonder why ? Didn't movie producers pay them as well ? ;)\n",
      "probably not that much\n",
      "...but they probably did and special effect staff agreed to it... maybe Keanu could give that money to charity... :) Just thinking at loud ;)\n",
      "Did you know that until 1800 both hand knitting and machine knitting were used to make socks but after 1800 it was mostly machines knitting\n",
      "It's hard for me to believe that :) I'm sure a lot of people were doing it the old way...\n",
      "It seems like you probably are right.  The acoustic era gave rise to the expression \"put a sock in it\" because people put a sock in the phonograph horn to mute it.\n",
      "lol ;) that's a one way to use it ! :) I wonder what were they doing when wife or husband were too loud or was talking too much :)\n",
      "lol.  I just learned that best buy and target will price match amazon.\n",
      "Bestbuy ? Do You believe that ? They are usually very expensive...\n",
      "I don't know but I hope so!  The first Target opened in 1962 in Minnesota.\n",
      "They both try to catch up after amazon, but I think Amazon will out perform both of these...\n",
      "It might in the long run.  Sears is going out of business and other malls that are brick and mortar sad to see.  Vermont is the only state to not have a Target store though.\n",
      "Not yet You mean :) I wonder why... any laws prohibiting it to open ? \n",
      " i don't know.  I doubt that.  Target hasn't carried any tobacco products since 1996.  Good for them.\n",
      "I mean morally good, but I'm guessing they lost a lot of money by doing so... don't You think ?\n",
      "I don't know.  Does walmart sell cigarettes?\n",
      "I wouldn't know, I've never smoked ):\n",
      "80% of supplements though sold in Walmart, walgreens, target and gnc contain none of the advertised herbs, so wonder how they can legally advertise?\n",

      "How's it going, did you know Michael Chiklis went bald because of a mishap with theater makeup?\n",
      "Really?  Id be so mad!\n",
      "Yea, Chiklis was only 20 at the time too, I wonder what makeup caused it\n",
      "Well, the Ancient greeks used white lead.  That couldnt have been good for them.\n",
      "Sounds like a bad idea. Did you know Clowns copyright their makeup designs on eggshells?\n",
      "No.  How does one even do that?  I am not into makeup myself.  Just never cared to wear any.  I think it is cook Keanu Reeves gave $80 million of his salary from teh matrix to the special effects and make up crew\n",
      "Keanu is a great guy. Apparently in Team America the Kim Jong-il statue was just a person in makeup\n",
      "Probably, make up can really transform you into almost anyone\n",
      "Yea, it's a shame that American cosmetic companies has gone back to animal testing though\n",
      "I thought they outlawed that a long time ago.  Poor animals.\n",
      "Apparently it's done so makeup can be sold in China\n",
      "Still doesnt make it right.  I guess since some of it is made from coconut oil it isnt as bad.\n",
      "Yea, places like Target should refuse to sell, I mean they already refuse to sell Tobacco in their stores\n",
      "And they have banned the salvation army bell ringers.\n",
      "I wonder why? I never knew Vermont doesn't have any Targets in the state\n",
      "They dont?  They are sure missing out.  Target is great, they have even trademarked the fake french \"target\" because it became so popular.\n",
      "That's pretty funny, I guess price matching Amazon helps Target be so popular\n",
      "It really would.  If I can grab it and not wait, I am good to go.\n",
      "Yea the amazon price match is a nice perk but it can be a hassle to deal with the Target employees\n",
      "Did you know it was founded the same year as Walmart?\n",
      "No, I had no clue. Well I have to go, nice chatting with you\n",

      "Hello. How are you?\n",

      "No. I never would have thought that.\n",
      "Me either. Chiklis went bald at 20 due to a bad makeup disaster.\n",
      "I did hear that before.\n",
      "I also saw clowns copyright their makeup designs on eggshells.\n",
      "That is  interesting. Keanu reeves gave 80 million of his matrix salary to special effects and makeup staff.\n",
      "Wow that's a lot of money! Good for him for doing that.\n",
      "Yes. very nice of him to treat those people  that way.\n",
      "Do you wear socks?\n",
      "Yes. most times.\n",
      "Same here. Did you know socks are among the most needed item in a homeless shelter?\n",
      "No. I was not aware of that.\n",
      "Do you like Target?\n",
      "Sure. I shop there once a month.\n",
      "I do as well. Best Buy and Target will price match Amazon which is really cool.\n",
      "Yes. That is one reason I like shopping there.\n",
      "Vermont is the only state without a Target store.\n",
      "That is surprising. I thought  that they were everywhere.\n",

      "Did you know Spider Man first appeared in comics back in 1962?\n",
      "I did not know that! Spiderman is one of my favorite heroes\n",
      "Mine too.  I like that he had to deal with real life struggles and even financial issues.\n",
      "Yeah I think his one of the poorest super heroes in the Marvel universe but one of the smartests ones as well.\n",
      "He did always seem to be short of money didn't he?  His enemies were mostly rich though I think.  I think the Green Goblin had money.\n",
      "Yeah thats a curious fact, most of his enemies had tons of cash I guess thats what makes Spiderman special\n",
      "Stan Lee created him to be special, right down to his name.  The only reason there is a hyphen in it is so he wouldn't be confused with superman.\n",
      "Thats funny lol,  his first appearance was on the comic book Amazing Fantasy, that comic book must be worth thousands now! at least the original version\n",
      "i imagine you are very right about that!  I wonder if that comic had Cap'n Crunch's arch rivals in it.  I've heard they have battled Spiderman at some point.\n",
      "I bet Spiderman whipped the floor with him lol, Sony bough the rights of Spiderman for $10 million I bet they regret not buying the rest.\n",
      "They thought the world would only care about Spiderman.  Don't get me wrong, Spiderman is great, but i do like the others too.\n",
      "Me too, I think the Marvel universe has great heroes and well movies has shown that to many.\n",
      "Not to mention the video games.  Spiderman has great video games, especially for Playstation.\n",
      "Yeah I have a Play Station 4 and just purchase the latest game, its really good I liked it a lot. Do you play video games?\n",
      "I play some.  Did you know that playstation 3's are being used to study black holes?\n",
      "Really? I wonder how many of them are being used, I did hear it was cheaper to gather play station 3s than to arm a supercomputer and the results were the same\n",
      "Apparently they are very powerful computers.  Xbox's are too.  The army uses the controllers to fly uav spy planes.\n",
      "I bought an xbox when it first came out, it made a creepy sound when it was on standby for too long.\n",
      "Did it really?  That's weird!  I honestly don't know which is better. Playstations came out in 1994 and Xbox came out in 2001 but they are both powerful, great game consoles.\n",
      "I think they are about the same, the only thing that changes are the games some are exclusive to one brand ot the other.\n",
      "And the fans of each.  For xbox a guy spent 2600 dollars on a carnival game to win one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Xbox or playstation?\n",
      "Personally I like the Xbox better. it's crazy that the first Xbox came out back in 2001 LOL I had one on launch day\n",
      "Me too, I love xbox, I great up with playstation then got my first xbox 360 after! Even though it red ringed, I still loved it!\n",
      "Hurry up my Xbox 360 also Red ringed, it's crazy that it sold 77 million units even with that problem\n",
      "wow, I tried getting my free one but i missed the warranty by like 1 week!\n",
      "That's really annoying! You have an Xbox One by the way? Apparently it has been released in 21 markets and came out back in 2014\n",
      "Yep, an I will never look back at playstation! Even the army uses xbox controllers to fly uav spy planes!\n",
      "Well I bet they save a lot of money using Xbox controllers instead of custom ones. It's also crazy that quadriplegics have special controllers that they can play Xbox 360 games with\n",
      "for sure, lol. That is awesome they look after everyone's ability. Have you heard of mikerowesoft.com?\n",
      "Haha no I haven't what is that? I just know that if you leave the original Xbox on too long that it starts to make weird noises on the dashboard, I remember those they were very strange\n",
      "Some kid made that website and sold the domain out of court for an xbox and games. Smart kid lol. I remember those also, scary in the middle of the night lol\n",
      "Haha that is crazy. You own a PlayStation by the way? It's crazy that the United States government put together 1800 PlayStation threes and built a supercomputer LOL\n",
      "I had a playstation 1-3 but my 3 only for netflix. playstation 2 was awesome, tony hawk was my game!\n",
      "Yeah PlayStation 2 is my favorite! And speaking of PlayStation threes, apparently they were being used to research black holes because they were so powerful\n",
      "wow, that is awesome! I never knew that. I used to play grand theft auto on playstation 2, did you play that?\n",
      "I did play that game. I played the one on PlayStation 2 though, not the original one, apparently if you put the original one into a CD player you could listen to a soundtrack which is awesome\n",
      "that would be awesome. I remember playing the first on PC but the overhead view kind of stinks. PS2 version was amazing!\n",
      "Yep I agree! I also played the video game Spider-Man for the Sega Dreamcast, and I think it's weird that stay used a hyphen in the name Spider-Man so that he wouldn't be confused with Superman, I don't know why they would be confused though haha\n",
      "that is funny, i never knew that lol. It makes sense though. I loved spider-man for playstation too. It was nice chatting with you!\n",
      "Thanks you too! And yes Stanley is the man, even his wife did the voice of Madame web in the Spider-Man series back in 1994 which is cool\n",
      "wow that is awesome! Enjoy your night!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi how are you? do you play video games?\n",
      "I'm doing well how are you? Yes I like playing video games, especially on Xbox!\n",
      "I have not played Xbox or PS. whhich do you prefer? why?\n",
      "I like xbox more because honestly it's the only system I've had. I remember getting one way back in 2001.\n",
      "Microsoft gets many things wrong, but ive heard good things about xbox games. i played games as a kid, but now, im not interested. what games do you like?\n",
      "I like the call of duty games and madden football games! I think it's cool they have controllers for quadriplegics for xbox 360!\n",
      "Madden is fun. i played madden many many years ago. controllers for quadriplegics? how do theydo that?\n",
      "I'm not sure, probably using their mind or something! The US army even uses xbox 360 controllers to fly uav spy planes! Crazy!\n",
      "those controllers are probably so well designed that anyone can learn them in five minutes. thats great! now i want a UAV spy plane of my own.\n",
      "It would be easy indeed! Are you into superhero characters like Spider-man?\n",
      "I like spider-man. most of the heroes are not so interesting to me. do you like spidey?\n",
      "I do! I think it's funny why spider-man has a hyphen in his name!\n",
      "yes, i never thought about that. Why?\n",
      "Stan lee didn't want anybody to confuse him with superman? I guess that's smart?\n",
      "Oh, ok. yeah, i could see that the spellings would look similar. plus superman is DC and spidey is marvel.\n",
      "Can you believe what Sony paid for the rights to Spider-man in 1998?\n",
      "they should have paid a lot for that character. he is quite valuable.\n",
      "I wonder how much money he has brought in for them? I know playstation has many games about him since they are Sony.\n",
      "Yeah, that would make sense. Sony wants to use its IP for its own platforms as much as possible. Anyway, great chat!\n",
      "The Department of Defense even uses playstations. They know what is up. Great chat with you as well. Have a good one!\n",
      "Have a great weekend!\n",

      "Hello, have you seen the movie Jurassic World?\n",
      "Helo there, yes I have and I like them all. Did you know dinosaurs in Jurassic Park only apperad for 15 minutes?\n",
      "Wow that is pretty short in a movie that is all about dinosaurs don't you think?\n",
      "haha I know. And the Jurassic Park ride cost twice as much as the whole movie\n",
      "\n",
      "That is insane, but I heard that is cost like $110 million, that is a ton of money\n",
      "Yeah pretty insane. Do you know how they generated the raptors in the movie?\n",
      "Yeah they had people get in suits and act, pretty cool considering everything is animated nowadays\n",
      "Yeah I know right? It took them 6 hours though to make one frame for t-rex in the rain all soaked up\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah that is a long time I guess that is why they opted for the suits for the raptors\n",
      "Yeah good point. Chriss Pratt joked about getting the lead and then got it later on\n",
      "Haha smart guy, it worked pretty well for him I guess. Did you see JUmanji?\n",
      "I did actually and liked it quite a lot. Did you know the boy from Jumanji was the voice of chip from Beauty and the Beast?\n",
      "Wow nice. it had a budget of $91 million and the Rock alone got 1/4 of it and some more\n",
      "Yeah he made a ton of money. The opening weekend was $36 million alone\n",
      "Yeah and they went on to make over $1 billion worldwide\n",
      "Yeah that is a ton o fmoney, wow. Do you know who was the voice of Slick in the Jumanji cartoon?\n",
      "Yeah I think I read somewhere that it was TIm Curry, pretty cool\n",
      "Yeah that is. Do you know much about physics?\n",
      "I know some stuff like Kim Jung Un has a degree in it\n",
      "Wow I guess he is smart. It seems if physics laws had not been violated the universe would have no existed\n",
      "That is cool then with me if that had to happen\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi there, have you ever seen Jurassic Park movies?\n",
      "Yes, I have. There good! Have you?\n",
      "Yeah I have seen some of them. The dinosaurs appear only for 15 minutes in the movies\n",
      "Interesting. Those movies keep you glued to your seat. Interesting the velociraptors were only waist high to an adult.\n",
      "Yeah, and yet we think they were so big, all of them. Do you know how they got the Raptors in the movie?\n",
      "What do you mean get them in?  Interesting, originally Jurassic world was going to be about human like raptor hybrids!\n",
      "Oh I just meant they were not animated but they had people inside suits\n",
      "Oh really, that makes sense. I think I saw something about that. very cool!\n",
      "Yeah. Have you ever ridden in the jurassic park ride?\n",
      "Yes, many times! I love how it spins you around and around Jerks about. my gosh its a ride. lol\n",
      "Nice. Apparently it cost $110 million to build it, that is a lot of money\n",
      "Hold on, I was reading about Jumanji and thinking about the mummy ride at Universal. the Jurassic Park ride line was 90 minutes. Haven't got to that one yet. I have seen it all very cool at night! Wait and go early and get a fast pass. lol Have you?\n",
      "I have not yet. But I was surprised to learn that it cost to build twice more than the movie itself\n",
      "Yes, I was surprised to know Jonathan Hyde is from Australia. Have you seen Jumanji?\n",
      "I have seen it and I like it. The movie made so much money $1 billion workdwide\n",
      "Wow, that's alot! The Rock got a good chunk of that $91 million.\n",
      "That is amazing. Did you know the voice of Jumanji is also the voice of chip from Beauty and the Beast?\n",
      "Chip? Oh, I loved that movie and its voice. lol\n",
      "Yeah me too. On another topics, do you have much interest in science?\n",
      "Yes, very interesting! I believe that hubble telescope found a galaxy so vast, it shouldn't exist!\n",
      "That is so cool. Did you know Kim Jong-Un has a degree in physics?\n",
      "Really, would have never thought of that! Good chat!!\n",
      "Same here, have a good one. \n",

      "Hi. How are you\n",
      "I'm fine.  Thanks for asking and you?\n",
      "I am fine too\n",
      "Do you like watching movies?\n",
      "Sure. Mystery,Comedy. Sci Fy, Action\n",
      "Have you seen Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom?\n",
      "No. Not yet how is it?\n",
      "I saw it and it was pretty good.  Its the fifth installment of the Jurassic Park film series.  Have you seen all of them?\n",
      "Yes. I thought the first was the best  out of the 4 that I saw\n",
      "That's a classic for sure.  Do you know the primary sound used to create the T-rex roar was an elephants roar?  That's incredible, isn't it?\n",
      "Yes. I had heard that.  Good job on that\n",
      "You know, despite its title, almost all the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park actually lived during the Cretaceous period.\n",
      "I didnt know that\n",
      "I guess Jurassic Park sounded jazzier than crusty Cretaceous Park? lol\n",
      "I agree. It dose not flow very well\n",
      "I suppose creative license to make it sound better to the ear.  Do you realize that the velociraptors were only waist high to an adult human?\n",
      "Yes I had read that somewhere. \n",
      "Did you ever have one of those Dino sized meals from Mcdonald's?\n",
      "No. I have not been to Mcdonald's in a few years. I used to grab a big mac once in awhile\n",
      "Me either, I try to avoid the fast food route.\n",
      "I prefer real meat if i am going to eat meat\n",
      "Lol, well it's been nice chatting with you this lovely, fine Florida afternoon.  I got to go wash my cat, if you know what I mean, I'll talk to you later, friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi there. Have you heard of the Razzie Awards? Seems to award the worst movies of the year!\n",
      "Yes I am very aware of the Razzies. I've been shocked about some of the people that have won. \n",
      "Yes I really like Mark Wahlberg so was surprised to hear he got a double nomination.\n",
      "He has had good and bad performances. Great in the Departed and horrible in The Happening. \n",
      "Yes very much agree. Also not so good in Daddy's home 2 and Transformers, although I liked those movies.\n",
      "I am not surprised that the Madea movies have been nominated. \n",
      "No surprise there! Also The Snowman, which looked like a cheesy horror film!\n",
      "It did look awful. Since you mentioned Transformers, did you know that in the 2007 film there are 1.53 explosions per minute?!\n",
      "Wow that is a lot of explosions. I guess people really like explosions because the movies ended up grossing over a billion!\n",
      "That's surprising when Age of Extinction did so well with a Rotten Tomatoes score of 15%. \n",
      "Yes that is a terrible scoring indeed. Optimus prime has died more than 25 times in the last 30 years. He's got more lives than a cat.\n",
      "Wow! That seems very excessive. \n",
      "Yes it does. Michael Bay was seen in the first film .He was the human flicked away by Megatron.\n",
      "I did not notice that. Apparently the CGI in the movie was very complicated. One frame of movement took 38 hours to render!\n",
      "That is so much work. Do you like other action movies like Jurassic world? I loved Jurassic Park so was hesitant when they announced Jurassic World.\n",
      "I liked Jurassic World but not it's sequel Fallen Kingdom. \n",
      "Yeah I liked them both but not Fallen Kingdom as much. Chris Pratt is one of my favorite actors and he actually once joked about being in Jurassic Park in 2010. Glad it worked out for him.\n",
      "That is funny. Did you know that the movie cost $63 million to make but the ride cost $110 million?\n",
      "Wow that is hard to believe although I have been on that ride and it is so much fun. The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park only appear in the film for 15 minutes surprisingly. It was nice talking with you today.\n",
      "I had no idea they were in it so little. They had a big impact. It was nice talking to you as well. \n",
      "Have a good one and watch out for those dinosaurs :)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey there did you ever watch the TV show Transformers in the 80s?\n",
      "Of course, who didn't? The original show? \n",
      "Yes I watch the cartoon and also some of the movies. I really like the cartoon, and only like the first movie. What about you\n",
      "The first movie released by Bay? \n",
      "That's a good point, yes I saw that movie and also the original animated movie, I liked both of those movies but the rest were horrible LOL\n",
      "Yeah, they were. They all totally were not good. \n",
      "I agree with you. Michael Bay is an ok director though, he directed the movie The Rock which is really good.\n",
      "Yeah, the Rock is a great movie, are you kidding me? \"WELCOME TO THE ROCK!\"\n",
      "LOL I'm glad you know what that movie is! It's a very different movie from the 2007 Transformers movie which had one-and-a-half explosions per minute apparently\n",
      "Yeah, well, I liked the original Cartoon Transformers, to be honest. \n",
      "Yes the cartoon was the best. Even though the live action movies took 38 hours to render just one frame, because they were so complicated, they still didn't impress me\n",
      "Is that true? I think that might be an exaggeration, right? \n",
      "No I do think that's true on another movies note, why did you think of Jurassic world Fallen Kingdom? I thought it was horrible\n",
      "I haven't seen it, but I'll take your word for it. \n",
      "The original Jurassic Park is the best, even though the dinosaurs in it only appear for about 15 minutes\n",
      "Yeah, I thought it was good too. Does this one have Goldblum? \n",
      "Yes it does for only a couple scenes. But it's honestly not worth seeing the movie just for him.\n",
      "No, it's not. He's not that great of an actor to be honest. \n",
      "I agree with you. I do like Chris Pratt though. I guess he joked with Steven Spielberg about being the lead in Jurassic Park four back in 2010, how right he was lol\n",
      "They got up to 4? OMG, where have I been? \n",
      "Well they did the Remake which I guess counts as four LOL. Trust me you're not missing anything\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Ive always like costumes, I love halloween because of that, what about you?\n",
      "Halloween is ok. I never got into it. Do you go all out for it?\n",
      "I do, every year a new costume, you know Panda researchers wear a panda costume for work.\n",
      "I did not know that. Makes sense but I would not wear it during mating season.... That might be scary!\n",
      "It would be scary indeed lol, do you know who Johnny Depp is?\n",
      "I do He spends a ton of money on wine every month, like $30K.\n",
      "Thats a lot of money for sure! well he dresses up in Jack Sparrows costumes and visits sick kids at hospitals, I think thats admirable.\n",
      "So cute. Although that character might be a little scary for some kids... I'm sure he does great with it though...\n",
      "I get your point, might be really scary for some kids, you know Sean Bean from Lord of the Rinds is actually scared of heights.\n",
      "I did read that he hiked instead of flying. Seems like a waste of time. Just sedate him and take off.\n",
      "I know right lol, that would be a fun approach anyway do you like the Gucci brand?\n",
      "Not really as I am not into status or prestige items. Do you know anything about them that might change my mind?\n",
      "Not really, I do know some interesting facts about the brand do you want to know one?\n",
      "Yes, please!\n",
      "Ok so Rick Harrison actually dropped out of school to sell fake Gucci bags, he earned about 2000 a week from that.\n",
      "Wow, that's a lot of money for fake bags. Who's Rick Harrison?\n",
      "His a businessman, and really tv personality have you watched Pawn Stars?\n",
      "I have... That's Rick Harrison???? Didn't Chumly get busted for drugs?\n",
      "He did? there was always something off with Chumly lol the founder of Gucci was called Guccio Gucci.\n",
      "That's a unique name... Chumly was weird. I only saw like 4 episodes...\n",
      "It is, it has an italian pronunciation and Gucci was founded in 1921. I used to like the Pawn shop because of all the history and facts you discovered in the show.\n",
      "\n",

      "The Razzie awards are an interesting award show.  Have you seen it?\n",
      "I haven't heard of them until recently. I think it's a funny concept, to poke fun at some of Hollywood's worst productions, but I feel bad for the nominees! Have you seen them?\n",
      "I have only read about them, but I have definitely seen some horrible movies..\n",
      "I have too! Have you seen The Room? It's my favorite terrible movie, they actually made a movie about its cult following called Disaster Artist with Tommy Wiseau. Have you heard of this? That definitely deserves a Razzie award@\n",
      "I have not seen it!  The Mummy was another awful movie, but my all time favorite was Attack of the Killer Tomatoes from the 1950s\n",
      "I have heard of The Mummy but never saw it. What is Attack of the Killer Tomatoes about? \n",
      "It is literally giant tomatoes invading earth.  It is horribly bad!   Another movie called Mother! got some Razzie awards\n",
      "That's hilarious. Yeah, that stars Jennifer Lawrence right? Did you know Razzie put Tyler Perry in the worst actresses category for his Madea movies?\n",
      "That is funny about the worst actresses. I wonder if Walberg has ever had a nomination/\n",
      "Yeah I haven't seen those movies but I heard they were just awful. Another hilariously bad movie is called Rubber, it's a horror movie. Have you seen or heard of it? It deserves a Razzie for sure.\n",
      "I have never seen Rubber.  I have seen the movie The Snowman - that is a ghastly movie.\n",
      "Rubber is about a killer tire that comes to life. It came out in 2011 I think. What is The Snowman about?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was shot and released with a lot of missing footage.  10-15 percent of the screenplay was never shot!\n",
      "That's crazy! Did they just not have enough time to shoot? I think that's by Tomas Alfredson, no? He's had some decent movies before\n",
      "Yes he has.   I think the best was when Adam Sandler was nominated for both best actress and actor in the same film!\n",
      "That's so funny! How is that even possible? Is that from Jack and Jill?\n",
      "yes on Jack and Jill where he played opposite sex fraternal twins\n",
      "That's so funny. Good for Adam Sandler, but I guess he wasn't very good in it.\n",
      "Yes it was apparently not the best film.  But Tyler Perry has been nominated for best actress a whole bunch of times\n",
      "I'm not sure how I feel about that. If it was best female character, then maybe, but he's not an actress, he's an actor. Seems a little transphobic to me, but maybe that's just me?\n",
      "Yeah it is definitely a bit odd.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you wear a costume for halloween ever?\n",
      "my mom and dad used to dress me up in costumes for halloween sometimes. How about you?\n",
      "lol me too, I remember seeing pictures of some ridiculous costumes. I want to be a panda researcher though\n",
      "why a panda researcher? what are the attractions and benefits of such a career?\n",
      "you get to wear panda costumes while working with them!\n",
      "ok, i guess that is pretty cool. that panda costume must get a bit hot  though, right? i worry that it make me look uncool too.\n",
      "that is true lol, I think it would look so cool, but maybe not the more i think about it lol. Tell you one thing though, Johnny Depp dresses as jack sparrow and goes to hospitals to cheer sick kids up\n",
      "He is a great guy for doing that for the kids. Other stars sometimes do that, but he is probably popular with the youngsters.\n",
      "for sure, who doesn't like Pirates of the Caribbean! do you ever dress in Gucci clothing?\n",
      "i do not. i cannot afford the gucci. but it sure looks cool. do you have the gucci?\n",
      "I cannot either, I have some fake gucci belts, i just tell people they are real, they don't know any difference!\n",
      "i wouldnt know the difference either. i do not know fashion. i should learn and become more fashionable.\n",
      "Me too, lol. Did you know the creator of gucci was named guccio gucci?\n",
      "that is a silly sounding name? gucci o'gucci? it sounds irish!\n",
      "Ha it sounds something, but I bet it is Italian or something like that lol. You can make good money selling fake gucci, some guy started a 2000 dollar a week business doing it\n",
      "that sounds much better than, say, doing online chatting for cash. i could get into the fake gucci. give myself the name gucci o'gucci.\n",
      "lol, that is a good start to a successful business. Have Rick Harrison from Pawn Stars get you started lol!\n",
      "yes, a pawn broker probably knows the value of things pretty well. he will know how to price fake goods. that is a good tip. thanks.\n",
      "that is a good point, it was so nice chatting on you, I think we have a nice business plan!\n",
      "Nice chatting with you! It is a perfect plan. we cannot fail.\n",
      "Have a good night!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi, do you watch the transformers?\n",
      "I have seen it yes, but I like the cartoons from the 80's the best, what about you?\n",
      "Nice, I have seen the first one, the original and I heard the rest were not great\n",
      "ya thats what I heard as well, I know they came out with a new movie Bumblebee that should be good but I didn't see that either\n",
      "yeah me either. it is a series of movies that made billions but their rating is so low\n",
      "yup that is crazy, also crazy is in the 2007 movie there are about 1.5 explosions per minute, thats insane\n",
      "that sure is. optimus prime dies more than 25 times over 30 years\n",
      "ya thats a lot haha, that includes all the comics, cartoons, and movies, etc, its amazing they keep bringing him back\n",
      "that sure is a lot, that guys is indestructible indeed\n",
      "oh ya definitely, in the first transformers movie do you remember the part where Megatron flicks a person away?\n",
      "yeah I heard that was michael bay\n",
      "yup thats true, and also it took 36 hours just for a comp. to render one frame in that movie too\n",
      "yeah that is insane. how about jurassic world, do you like it?\n",
      "well I didn't like it sad to say, I like the first one best, even though the dinos only show up for about 15 mins total\n",
      "do you know how much it cost to create jurassic park?\n",
      "how much? I do know that there was a jurassic park ride that cost like 110 million\n",
      "yeah that one, that is crazy and the movie only cost $63 million\n",
      "ya thats a bargain, funny the raptors were so scary in that movie and they were just actors in suits\n",
      "yeah. did you know chris pratt joked about having the lead and then got it years later\n",
      "haha that is funny, also funny how it took like 6 hours to render one frame of a trex for that movie, probably would be a lot faster now\n",
      "Oh I bet for sure. nice chat\n",

      "Rihanna was stunning at the Met Gala, she definetely catched a lot of glances.\n",
      "Yes she was, all the outfits gets more glory than the awards\n",
      "I know! I did love her outfit, I am a Rihanna fan and this made me love her even more.\n",
      "I am a fan of hers too. KIm K, I wasn't feeling too much though, you?\n",
      "Yeah me neither, what did you think about Katy Perry and her wings?\n",
      "I thought it was super creative, I saw some behind the scenes pics of her getting dressed, it was a lot of work\n",
      "I thought the wings were a nice touch, they gaved the gala something to be remembered by. \n",
      "Yes, the red carpet IS the show, I don't think I have ever actually seen the awards, lol\n",
      "You should definetely see the upcoming ones, I am going to watch them with friends. \n",
      "That sounds like fun, I may do the same thing, make a night of it.\n",
      "Yeah, you should give it a try, I wonder what surprises will bring this years awards!\n",
      "Let's see what Nikki Minaj comes up with this time, lol.\n",
      "She will definetely come up with something weird lol, its crazy how they spend that much money on their clothes for the Gala.\n",
      "Right and Gucci Gucci everywhere...\n",
      "Yeah, its crazy how much a Gucci article is worth. \n",
      "Catholicism and fashion, I wonder how they come up with the themes.\n",
      "No idea, but its crazy how Rick Harrison dropped out of high school and became a millionare out of Gucci\n",
      "Right $2,000 a week from fake gucci bags, lol.  Where do I sign up? lol\n",
      "I know! $2000 a week would be nice to have\n",
      "I wonder if they look at it like it's Halloween (the Met)? lol... \n",
      "Some of them definetely do! its crazy how its become a competition. \n",
      "Yes, and what a competition it is, a fashion contest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi, do you like fashion brands?\n",
      "I am a fashion misfit. You?\n",
      "I do not follow them much nor buy their expensive clothes\n",
      "Like the Italian brand, Gucci?\n",
      "yeah, like that one. do you know when it was founded?\n",
      "Back in 1921 if I am remembering correctly.  I think it was in Florence, Italy.  I bet they make a lot of money!\n",
      "Yeah they do for sure, 4.2 billion euros\n",
      "I bet they are in the top 110 brands with that kind of an income! DOn't you think?\n",
      "Oh they for sure are. do you know who rick harison was?\n",
      "No, is he with Gucci?\n",
      "no but he made a living selling fake gucci bags, $2000 a sweek\n",
      "Not bad... You know, the first woman to run a major motion picture stuudio in the US who started her career out by selling toilet paper with the Gucci brand! \n",
      "wow that is amazing. do you know the name of the founder ?\n",
      "Guccio Gucci! WHat a great name!  I call him \"the gooch\"  Now, you can buy \"ecclesiastical clothing\" from Gucci!\n",
      "did you know tom for the designer, is also a director\n",
      "Nope. New to me! Did yo know that Hugh Jackman walked around the Comic Con wearing his WOlverine costume?  I wonder if it wa Gucci?\n",
      "yeah I wonder too now. do you listen to music?\n",
      "Sure. I listen to al lot of older stuff, not like Katy Perry or any of the newer artists. You?\n",
      "A mix of ebverything, at least I try to. katty perry has received 11 grammy nominations and never won\n",
      "My daughter told me that KP tied Michael Jackson's record of 5 Billboard #1 singles off of a single album, but I couldn't tell yo the name of one of her songs...\n",
      "Yeah she is pretty popular. nice chat\n",

      "Did you play with Legos growing up?\n",
      "I did play with Legos, my favorite, what  about you?\n",
      "Me too! I think its really cool that if all the lego bricks produced were shared out equally every single person on earth would own 86 lego bricks. \n",
      "86 bricks per person, wow that is a lot of plastic, too much for our environment to handle\n",
      "I am wondering if they have had a lot of back lash for the plastic usage?\n",
      "They must cause a lot of contamination that is a sure thing, I heard Lego is investing millions to make sure their new pieces are safe for the environment\n",
      "I think thats a great idea to ditch their oil-based plastics in search of environmentally friendly alternatives.\n",
      "I think its a great idea as well, making their product safer for the environment, did you hear about that German graffiti artist, the one that painted a bridge and made it look like it was made out of legos\n",
      "I want to see a picture of that! I am sure it attracts a lot of tourists. \n",
      "It must right, hopefully the city didnt erase his work of art,\n",
      "I had no idea that they replaced Ferrari as Brand Finance's world's most powerful brand.\n",
      "Wow, thats a huge step up, there is a 14 karat gold lego given to employees back in the 80s\n",
      "They are values at nearly $15,000. That is an expensive lego.\n",
      "That is really expensive I agree, did you watch the Lego Batman movie?\n",
      "I did not. Did you? \n",
      "I watched it, Batman is my favorite hero, the Dark Knight, such a great hero\n",
      "Did you know that there was a batman villain named condiment king?\n",
      "I didnt know that, what are his powers lol, \n",
      "Not sure but he was defeated by slipping on his own ketchup.\n",
      "Sounds like his powers were his own kryptonite after all, do you know who Adam West is?\n",
      "Yes, it is funny that the logo is on his molar. \n",
      "Yeah the same one, he must be a big fan lol\n",
      "That is a commitment. Too bad not many people will even see it.\n",
      "Yeah its well hidden, in a tough spot, \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I don't understand how netflix can have 150 movies with a 100% rotten tomato rating. Perhaps they are movies no one has bothered to watch. Have you ever seen a movie with a 100% rating?\n",
      "No, I haven't.  100% for anything subjective is crazy.   I will say that my husband will agree with the 38% score for Michael Bay. lol\n",
      "haha. I have a feeling that kids are taking over the world. Spy kids at 93%? I remember I liked it, but I don't remember it being an A rating. Also it's hilarious that Legos replaced Ferrari as Brand Finances world's most powerful brand. Maybe these companies are targeting children as their next target audience?\n",
      "I would say these companies are really smart.  The brands not only target children but all ages.  Where a ferrari can only be used by adults, Legos can be used and reused by people of all ages and can be reconstructed into different shapes.  And man i wish i worked for Lego and got one of those golden bricks did you hear about that?\n",
      "I didn't hear about that. That's crazy. I think it's cool that they care about the people that have invested time into their company. Lego is dope. They are infiltrating everything. Movies, amusement parts, living room floors. Also it's cool how they partnered with whoever owns the rights to batman. Seems like a legit company but its weird that Rotten tomatoes gives certain movies such high ratings while other historical informative movies get a low rating. Like I understand that it's boring, but damn.\n",
      "I think its crazy how all of these large companies or websites started.  Take Rotten Tomatoes, I remember it from high school it was in its infancy and to think it was created by 3 undergrad college kids.  The concept is so simple but so great.  I know as a young adult I didn't want to have to rely on the older critics for movie reviews to decide if I wanted to see a movie, but like you said with Spykids getting a higher rating the the almighty Batman i'm not so sure about all the scores on this website either lol.\n",
      "Oh. That makes sense. If it was us rating the movie at a young age, then it would get a higher rating than the Abraham Lincoln movie. Makes sense. Because of the internet, anyone is allowed to place their opinion on certain subjects. Democracy. \n",
      "Speaking of Batman, he is my favorite superhero!!  He appeared in the 27 Detective Comics in 1939.  What is so great about Batman is that he doesn't have powers, but is brute strength and genius intellect.\n",
      "They have come a long way. They've created tons of DC movies. So is Batman is the same universe as Aquaman? Like how everyone in Marvel is now in one movie... is that the same thing? I wonder if there is a connection with Lego and Batman. I know that Marvel doesn't own spiderman and has to lease the rights in order to make the movie.... there are so many different spidermans.\n",
      "I'm not sure if they are in the same universe all of that is so convoluted.  I actually didn't get into the comics like that but I do know DC is trying to create the same type of universe as Marvel but its not quite working out.  Batman had a hilarious villain though he had one called condiment king and he was defeated by slipping on his own ketchup.\n",
      "True. I know that Marvel is owned by Disney so they have their stuff together. Yeah, I kind of feel bad for DC comics but If they stick with it hopefully they can build a strong team. That's hilarious. And really weird and creative and I honestly would love to see that made into a movie. Especially because I feel like my generation is into weird stuff.\n",
      "I take it you are a millennial  I remember growing up with all of the cartoons in the morning on Saturdays and in the afternoons after school so there is definitely a market for batman and I'm still going back to the rating on rotten tomato for the movie I cannot believe that it wasn't like an A rating.  Adam West even has a batman logo on one of his molars how awesome is that?\n",
      "I am. Same. I always check rotten tomatoes and if its a splat then I'm not wasting my time. Sometimes I read stuff by critics and I'm like... youre the worst. Also in film school everyone says the same crap and its annoying. Yes Bugs Bunny is the best. I remember watching the one where they're like... children bunnies.. I don't know. Thats crazy dedication to Adam west! Have you seen the one with Ben Affleck? \n",
      "No, I refuse to watch it I'm on some weird strike. hahahaha  I need to see it just so I can have an intelligent argument.  I really like the Christian Bale I thought he was a great Batman but from what i hear Ben Affleck was a great Bruce Wayne.  I cannot wait to see the new joker by Joaquin Phoenix i want to see if the saying holds true that face to face batman and joker never mention each other by name. \n",
      "hahaha. I totally understand. TBH I don't remember anything special about it. I also don't remember the plot which is crazy because.... shouldn't they all have the same plot. Yeah I only remember Bain because I highkey love Tom Hardy. Terrible, I know. Oh wow Joaquin should be bomb. He's a great actor. I wonder if there is a significance to them not calling each other by name. I wonder if the Lego Batman movie got a good Rotten Tomatoes rating. I bet you it did. I hope I create something one day as successful as the three undergraduate students. Are they all asian? Of course. I'm only part asian so... not looking great.\n",
      "Yes I wish I came up with something like that as well.  Were you aware that Weird al yankovic did some voiceover work on the most recent animated batman vs robin\n",
      "Sure did. From Factual sectional 3. Before that, I did not. Do you think he started as a voice actor then became famous after or vice versa?\n",
      "You know it wouldn't surprise me if that was the way it happened with the different songs he comes up with.\n",
      "He surely is animated. haha... it's too late. I like that Lego is trying to do away with plastic. Like how Batman tries to do away with crime. Wow, I am really reaching now. \n",
      "Yes, doing away with plastic is a great strategy for Lego to remain relevant and reduce their impact on the earth.  That is all the rage these days lol.\n",
      "Sure is! Save the Planet! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I love reading rotten tomatoes. Especially since they tell it like it is for Michael bay's movies.\n",
      "I know! I tust Rotten Tomatoes as well, usually they give accurate reviews specially with Netflix movies.\n",
      "Did you know it was owned by Warner Bros? That is surprising since they no doubt have some movies with poor reviews on it.\n",
      "I didnt know that! and I guess its unbiased, that tells you a lot about the service.\n",
      "I guess they can't control what people have to say. No video game based movie has ever gotten about 44% Mortal Kombat was pretty good I'd give it a much higher rating.\n",
      "I guess some people dont like the franchise, I love to play Mortal Kombat games but I am more of a Batman fan.\n",
      "I like batman too. Did you know Weird Al did some voice work in batman vs robin?\n",
      "I didnt know that, I think the most amazing aspect of Batman is that he doesnt have superpowers.\n",
      "Yes, he's just smarter then all the bad guys. It also doesn't hurt that he is rich and has the money to develop all kinds of technology.\n",
      "Yeah, I agree, not everything is powers and Alfred is a badass as well. \n",
      "Robin is underrated too. I wish there were more Robin Lego sets.\n",
      "I know, I wish that too so you are a Lego fan?\n",
      "Yes! I love lego even though my last set came with a defective piece. The odds are so slim since only 18 out of every million are defective.\n",
      "That are some crazy odds, did you file a complaint? I think its great how lego is ditching their oil based plastics and seeking environemental friendly options. \n",
      "No I didn't complain. It's the first time it's happened. I have some of my parents old lego and the pieces from 1958 still fit with todays! I am glad they are switching the plastic finally.\n",
      "Did you hear about the german graffitti artist that made a bridge look like it was made out of legos?\n",
      "I saw pictures of it. It would have been neat to see. 250 Square meters! That's massive.\n",
      "Yeah I know, I wonder if they painted over this artwork, I think it would be great just to leave it there.\n",
      "What a shame. When we are done talking I think I'll go play a star wars lego game.\n",
      "I havent played that game, I might buy it I liked the Lego Batman game.\n",
      "You should go get it now. I'm off to play. Bye!\n",
      "Bye, have a nice day\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you think Rotten Tomatoes is a good site for reviews\n",
      "I don't know.  I tend to shy away from reviews.  Although Netflix has almost 150 reviews on there with a 100 percent rating.\n",
      "Can a movie get a 100% rating I can only think of one or two, the company is owned by Warner Bros\n",
      "If it was myself doing the ratings, I would be hard to give any movie a 100 percent review.  Nothing in the world is 100 perfect except maybe our kids.  lol  Spykids received a 93 percent on there.\n",
      "I thought Spykids was a great movie, but 93% seems really excesive lol\n",
      "Yes!  No video game on there has ever achieved higher than a 44% rating.\n",
      "Do you like Legos? did you ever play with them as a child or even later?\n",
      "I did!  I think that's like a rite of passage for all children to play with Legos.  There are so many Legos that if they were divided out to every person on earth, each person would own 86 lego bricks!\n",
      "86 bricks per person no kidding! its a good thing the company is replacing their oil-based plastics and searching for a friendlier alternative to the environment\n",
      "Yes!  I agree.  As of July 2015 600 billion Lego parts had been produced.  That's a lot of plastic!\n",
      "A lot of plastic and a big impact to the environment, did you hear about that graffiti artist, the one that painted a Lego bridge?\n",
      "I didn't until you just told me!  Lego replaced Ferrari as the worlds most powerful brand in 2015.\n",
      "I guess every kid likes to play with Legos, do you like Batman? he is my favorite hero\n",
      "I do!  Hard to believe he originally appeared in a comic book in 1939!\n",
      "Yeah it was DC comics #27 comic book, the Dark Knight what a great name and story, a hero without powers\n",
      "Yes!  Batman's Gotham City is located in New Jersey according to DC Canon.\n",
      "That manor must be worth a lot of money then lol, there was a villain named Condiment King, funny how he was defeated\n",
      "lol Did he slip on his own ketchup by any chance?\n",
      "Yeah he did lol, thats how he was defeated, \n",
      "Funny stuff!  Did you know that Adam West has a batman logo on one of his molars?\n",
      "I bet the Joker laughed at the Condiment King, and no I didnt know that about Adam West\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey! Did you see Wonder Woman when it came out (or since then)?\n",
      "I have not seen the new WW movie. Have you?\n",
      "I did see it. I'm not a big fan of superhero movies in general but I wanted to support movies with female superhero leads\n",
      "Yeah, that is a good idea. i figure that women heroes need to be more visible. i usually dont watch those movies because the explosions and battle scenes get dull.\n",
      "That's exactly how I felt when I watched it. And of course the compulsory heteroromantic subplot felt so unoriginal\n",
      "well, it is showbusiness. the producers want to make money and they go with the safe bets. younger audiences are probably more open to new plot lines.\n",
      "Yeah. I hear the new Captain Marvel has no love story, which makes me more likely to see it, honestly.\n",
      "Yeah, i prefer something other than simple love stories, especially in super hero films. \n",
      "I'd also like to see older superheroes; I don't mean like Robert Downey Jr., but more like Denzel Washington who at least has grey in his hair.\n",
      "Yeah, the genre has the potential to appeal to wide audiences if the stories and stars have enough variety.\n",
      "Although I'll never get tired of Leo DiCaprio in anything. Hopefully he'll be in the Twilight Zone movie he's producing\n",
      "Is he? i did not know that. he is a gifted actor. i enjoy his work immensely.\n",
      "I feel the same way. I'm glad he finally won an Oscar. Before that, his only major award was a Golden Globe from 2004\n",
      "He has been overlooked for too long, but many other big names get the cold shoulder from hollywood. too political.\n",
      "Yeah, that's probably true. Also, he apparently was hanging onto Marlon Brando's Oscar award and Picasso painting that he had to surrender to the US govt. Maybe he was blacklisted from receiving awards over that? lol \n",
      "That is odd. i think that some people end up on a black list, like richard gere. \n",
      "What happened with him? Was it the hamster thing, the Buddhist thing, or something else?\n",
      "Yeah, he made a comment about Tibet and the Dalai Lama or something. that is a big no no. he will never be back.\n",
      "Was that after 9/11 when he said everyone should forgive and forget or was this something more recent? I vaguely recall something recently happening\n",
      "I dont remember. hollywood has a political line and stars have to stick to it. anyway, great chat!\n",
      "yeah, I guess there's pressure to be liberal/progressive. Nice chat as well :)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi there, do you enjoy watching movies?\n",
      "I do like watching movies. I saw Wonder Woman recently, did you see it? What did you think\n",
      "I loved it and looking forward to the sequel. Seems Gadot was a real fighter, she was in Israeli defense forces\n",
      "Yeah I could see that. She did a good job with acting like she was a soldier and such. It's funny that when she auditioned, she thought she was auditioning for Catwoman, that's a completely different role\n",
      "Hahah go figure. Do you know what the role of wonder woman was when the character first appeared?\n",
      "No I don't know? Can you tell me?. What do you think about World War 1 movies? I don't think they make enough, and  the Wonder Woman movie is apparently the highest grossing one\n",
      "Well they made her the secretary, how cliche. And yeah now it is one of the highest grossing movies\n",
      "Yep that's true. And yeah, making her the secretary would definitely not fly today haha. What do you think about Leonardo DiCaprio by the way? I really liked him in Titanic \n",
      "I like him he is a good actor. He is apparently producing a Twilight zone movie\n",
      "That is interesting I didn't know that. I hope that movie is good. Have you ever seen the sitcom Growing Pains? Apparently Brad Pitt Matthew Perry and also Leonardo DiCaprio were in it at some point\n",
      "Oh no I have not seen that one. Despite his great work, he has only won one Golden Globe in his life\n",
      "Yeah that is crazy. He's actually a good actor in my opinion, have you seen the movie the Revenant? I didn't know that it was a remake of a 1971 movie\n",
      "Yeah it was actually a remake of the movie Man in the Wilderness. I liked it a lot\n",
      "Yep you're right. It was definitely an interesting movie. Have you ever seen the movie The Basketball Diaries? I heard it was good, but it definitely helped launch his career apparently\n",
      "I have not seen that one actually, maybe I should check it out. How about Denzel Washington, what do you think of him?\n",
      "Yeah he seems like a pretty good guy. I know that he played this actor\"grapes\"in the Fruit of the Loom commercials LOL I don't think I've seen those\n",
      "I have not seen those either, wow. And he has never done a sequel to any of his movies it seems\n",
      "That is interesting. And his family is really talented by the way too. His son plays for the St Louis Rams. What a family\n",
      "Niceee, did not know that. And the guy refused to pay to get a star in the hollywood walk of fame\n",
      "That is pretty funny. It must be out of principle because they definitely have the money, only $30,000, I guess they just don't want to support it perhaps? What do you think\n",
      "I honestly like their stand on this. THey have made great careers why would they need a star. Nice chatting with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you know that the Library of Congress has a National Book Festival? Do you think they have comic books there like Wonder Woman?\n",
      "No I didn't know that. Brad Meltzer is a great author though, he has some work at the Congress National Book Festival such as history decoded\n",
      "One book I really liked reading was Body of Lies by David Ignatius. I saw the movie made about it, too. Did you?\n",
      "I saw the movie. It has Leonardo DiCaprio I think it was directed by Ridley Scott. I actually liked that movie a lot. did you see the movie Wonder Woman by the way\n",
      "Yes! Wonder Woman was a great movie. I liked the graphics in it and the actress herself was great. She must have used stunt doubles, though?\n",
      "No I don't think so. She was actually in the Israeli Army so it wouldn't surprise me if she did all of her own stunts\n",
      "She's even cooler than I thought! I heard that when she auditioned she thought it was for Cat Woman instead of Wonder Woman!\n",
      "That's crazy because those are entirely different rolls! Amazing that Wonder Woman is the highest grossing superhero movie and also the highest grossing World War 1 movie!\n",
      "Did you know that Wonder Woman started out in the group of the Justice Society as a lowly secretary?\n",
      "I think that came out back in 1941 right? Oh wow how the times have changed that would not fly today\n",
      "I wonder if she was their first secretary? Also, if Wonder Woman is an Amazon, how can her fingers fit on a normal typewriter?\n",
      "That is a great question! What was interesting to me to was that in 2017 there were a lot of female lead movies, they were the top three highest grossing movies for that year\n",
      "That is very interesting! I like how Wonder Woman has a bunch of powers that let her fight almost like a Mortal Kombat character.\n",
      "That is really crazy! speaking of actors and actresses, what do you think about Leonardo DiCaprio? hes in some of my favorite movies like The Departed\n",
      "Yeah, Leo is great. I hear he was in that sitcom called Growing Pains but I didn't catch it. What's Eating Gilbert Grape was a good one he was in, too.\n",
      "Yes I like both those movies. I also like the movie Blood Diamond. Did you know that you was in an 80s sitcom back in the day?\n",
      "Do you think Leo or Denzel Washington have won more awards? He was good in the movie Training Day. Did you catch that one?\n",
      "I did see that one. I bet that Denzel  actually won more Awards, I guess he used to play the character grapes in Fruit of the Loom commercials which is funny to think about now\n",
      "I guess it was a good move for Denzel. You gotta start out small, but it is surprising to know he started out like any kid in a school play as a little cute fruit!\n",
      "LOL you're right!, it's impressive that Denzels son actually plays for the st. Louis Rams, talk about a talented family\n",
      "Very talented! Enough to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Too bad Denzel doesn't pay for his, though. Snoop Dogg also has a football playing son.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you seen the latest Wonder Woman (2017) movie?\n",
      "Not yet but I've heard Wonder Woman was one of the best DCEU movies released\n",
      "I heard it was good too.  I guess it was directed by a woman named Patty Jenkins from a screen play by Allan Heinberg.\n",
      "Yea it's interesting Wonder Woman is set during WWI, most movies avoid that time period\n",
      "True.  I guess Gal Gadot did a great job.  Makes sense, she knows war having served in IDF for two years.\n",
      "Yea, it's interesting that Wonder Woman is they highest grossing WWI movie in box office history\n",
      "WW I and Wonder Woman first appeared in 1941 the beginning of WW II for America?  Wonder why?\n",
      "Wonder Woman also appeared as a member of Justice Society in 1941 too\n",
      "Do you like Leonardo DiCaprio? He got his start in the 1980's sitcom Growing Pains...\n",
      "Yea, Leo is a great actor, I never knew his film debut was in Critters 3\n",
      "I didn't either.  The work is that he's producing a Twilight Zone movie.\n",
      "Hopefully it's pretty scary. sounds like it will be good if Leo is in the new Twlight Zone movie\n",
      "I always like the TZ. Did you see the movie The Revenant?   It was a 1971 film of wilderness survival.  Leo did a great job.\n",
      "The Revenant was pretty good, glad Leo won an Oscar for it\n",
      "How about Denzel Washington? Funny that he has never done a sequel to one of his movies.\n",
      "Yea Denzel is another amazing actor, funny that he used to do Fruit of the Loom commercials\n",
      "Yeah.  Have you ever heard of the Library of Congress' National Book Festival?  I guess they celebrate books such as \"The Inner Circle\", \"The Switch\" and even comic books like \"Spinning\" (graphic novel).\n",
      "Very little, I know Brad Meltzer wrote \"The Inner Circle\"\n",
      "The festival has all kinds of books including fantasy novels.  Another that became a movie is \"The Bone Collector\".  It sounds interesting.\n",
      "Yea, I heard they covered the book turned movie \" Body of Lies\"\n",
      "I haven't heard of that one.  Well, thanks for the chat!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good morning!  Have you heard of Stan Lee?  Did you know that he did cameos in all of the Marvel movies?\n",
      "I have! He was such a good writer! I love looking for him in his films!\n",
      "I do too and I agree, he was a good writer.  Sometimes he even speaks, like in Captain America, the Winter Soldier.\n",
      "I didn't know that! What else was he in?\n",
      "My favorites are the Iron Man appearances.  It seems like he had fun with those because in one Tony Stark thinks he's Hugh Hefner and in another he thinks he's Larry King!\n",
      "That is so cool! I'll have to look those up! I think I remember something about spiderman getting married. Do you?\n",
      "No I don't. Did he get married in one of the movies?\n",
      "I think so. The original spiderman got married to mary jane. 1987 i think? They did a whole public thing for it if I remember right.\n",
      "Well that's good. I use to be a fan of Spider Man back in the day and him marrying her is good!  Oh! That makes me think of Stan Lee's cameo in one of the movies.  He's standing on a street with Peter Parker and tells him that one man can make a difference!  How cool is that?\n",
      "That is very cool! I liked Stan Lee. I think the first spiderman made Stan Lee something like 800 million in revenue, but he didn't get any of it!\n",
      "That's so unfair!  He created something important. I mean, the military is even trying to achieve spider man like abilities.\n",
      "Wouldn't that be something to see! Have you seen Thor? I tried to watch it but had a hard time following it.\n",
      "I have see Thor and I really liked it.  I was impressed with the cast, especially that Anthony Hopkins was in it.\n",
      "What? I guess I didn't watch it long enough for that! Tom hiddleston tried out for Thor, instead he got Loki.\n",
      "I've heard that before. I heard he had to put on 50 pounds of muscle too.\n",
      "I can't even imagine working that hard for a role and not getting it! I did watch Ironman all the way thru. How bout you?\n",
      "I not only watched all the way through but watched all Iron Man movies.  I thought Robert Downy Jr. did an outstanding job!\n",
      "I thought so too! I did think he was a little too skinny for the role though! He is so small! Genyth Paltrow was amazing too. What was her name in it? Apple or something?\n",
      "I didn't notice.  I don't remember her name but she did do good.  The whole Iron Man story is so cool.  A super rich guy that is intelligent and builds things and becomes a hero?!  \n",
      "And he does it for everyone else too! I can't believe the first iron man came out almost 11 years ago!\n",
      "I know! It seems like it was just a few months ago!  I did sort of hate to see Jeff Bridges as the bad guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I was sad to see Stan Lee passed away. The Marvel movies just won't feel right without his cameos.\n",
      "I know the feeling, it wont be same without him, one of my favorites is the one in The Winter Soldier, so funny!!\n",
      "I think my all-time favorite was his Amazing Spider-Man appearance, where he was wearing the headphones as everything explodes behind him\n",
      "That was a good one as well, or the one when he drink a cup of a drink and has Hulks blood in it.\n",
      "That one is such a visceral memory for me, because he makes such a memorable sound when he tastes the kick to his bottle. He really knew how to set up the brand!\n",
      "He sure did, my favorite hero is Iron Man I loved it ever since 2008 I think Robert Downey Jr is a great actor.\n",
      "Oh yes, the Iron Man movies really launched the Marvel Cinematic Universe into what it is today. My personal favorite in the films is Thor I think.\n",
      "Thor is a great character as well, did you know 80% of the dialogue in Thor Ragnarok was improvised?\n",
      "That's incredible, because I completely love how it turned out. I just learned that Tom Hiddleston who plays Loki was originally screen testing to play Thor, but I think Chris Hemsworth really nailed the character.\n",
      "He did and Tom Hiddleston really nailed the Loki character as well, I think Loki stole the movie and the protagonism.\n",
      "He really did, which is so true to the comics. The first Thor by Kenneth Branagh just didn't use the support characters enough. Thor was never meant to be only about Thor, but his whole team of characters.\n",
      "I haven't seen those, but yeah, it's too bad Spider-Man movies haven't had a continuity but they keep on pulling new actors for the roll. \n",
      "Marvel has always had a lot wrapped up in the Spider-Man character as their flagship for their younger audience. I'm not surprised their movies are all over the place too.\n",
      "Did you know the military is trying to emulate Spidermans abilities for their soldiers?\n",
      "No that's crazy. That sounds like another Marvel gimmick honestly. They created a whole stunt wedding with actors when they married off the character in the 80s.\n",
      "Could be, sounds really difficult to alter humans to have similar abilities as Spiderman, it can be really dangerous, and I didnt hear about the 80s stunt, can you tell me a bit more?\n",
      "Just that they pretended to marry Peter Parker off to Mary Jane in the real world and let Stan Lee officiate. There he is again, knowing just how to create a wild brand stunt.\n",
      "Oh I see, interesting, and yeah, I see your point that definitely sells movies or at least creates interest in them. \n",
      "The fact that he was so well-known and considered a comic legend just shows how effective he was at those spots. Before Iron Man was released in 2008, many people didn't even realize comics were still being published.\n",
      "I can imagine after all the whole Marvel franchise is live because of him and will keep on living long after his death. \n",
      "He really gave them the right boost to start!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, do you like superhero movies?\n",
      "Yes I watch super hero movies all the time\n",
      "Nice. Have you seen Spider-Man, any of them\n",
      "Yes I've seen the first Spider-man movie in 2002 where Stan Lee made a cameo where he saved a little girl when a building exploded. \n",
      "Nice. Did you know the US military is trying to replicate the abilities of Spiderman?\n",
      "I never knew that.  Are they going to have soldiers bitten by radioactive spiders to give them super abilities? \n",
      "I guess we will have to wait and see how that whole plan that they seem to have develops\n",
      "Have you watched any of the Thor movies? \n",
      "I have actually, the 2011 one. Did you know antman made the debut in Thor?\n",
      "Wow I never knew that antman was in the Thor movie. I do remember that Ildris Elba played one of the gods in it and a bunch of white supremacists were upset a black man played the part. \n",
      "Yeah apparently Antman was in other superhero movies like Spider-man, Hulk and Iron-man. \n",
      "Did antman play in the first Ironman movie? The same movie that Jeff Bridges was in? \n",
      "I am not sure even which one he played in, I must not have been paying attention. Did you know Tom Hidleston originally auditioned for the role of Thor and not Loki\n",
      "That's amazing.  I never knew that. I don't think he was good for that part. I recall that the Odin's ravens from the Thor movie was in the Avengers movie when Thor and Loki were arguing on the mountain top. \n",
      "Yeah and he even went on to gain 50 pounds of muscle to make sure that he is set for the role of Thor\n",
      "Stan Lee made a cameo in Thor: The Dark World.  He was trying to get into a party if I recall. \n",
      "The man was a legend for sure. He got 10% of all profits on his characters\n",
      "Yeah he did lots of tours around the country going to comic conventions. He died recently at the age of 95. \n",
      "Yeah, he had a great career. Do you know who performed the opening of spider-man back in 1990?\n",
      "Spider-man in 1990? That is a bit before my time. Was it made by the same studio that makes them now? I do know that in the mid 90s James Cameron was supposed to make a Spider-man film with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Leonardo Dicaprio. It got cancelled though.   \n",
      "Maybe I am not sure but the singer was Joe Perry, lead guitarist of Aerosmith. It was nice chatting with you :)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "Good and you?  What do you think of Spider man?  I've heard the first movie made over 800 million dollars.\n",
      "I am well. I like spider man. I also like the X-men. Do you?\n",
      "I do like X-men.  Spider man is actually becoming kind of realistic in a way.  The u.s. military is attempting to copy some of his abilities.\n",
      "The red and blue suit would be weird on the Seals though... I would draw the line there.\n",
      "i would too!  I think I would rather wear an Iron Man suit, or exoskeleton as it's called.\n",
      "Or have telekinetic powers like some other characters.\n",
      "That could be great too.  It could be good to have the weapons they have like Thor's hammer or the Infinity Gauntlet.\n",
      "I would like Captain America's power and just have the ripped body and super strength. Not too assuming but bad a$$.\n",
      "That would be nice.  In real life I guess people don't look like that.  The guy that played Loki in Thor had to gain 50 pounds of muscle.\n",
      "Really? He seemed so slight in the movie. How much did he weigh before?\n",
      "I don't know and I agree with you. He did look thin.  I guess  maybe Chris Hemsworth, Thor in the movie, was really big in comparison.\n",
      "Stan lee gets 10% of all net profits based on his characters? He died a rich man!\n",
      "I imagine that he did at that!  His movies are hugely popular, so much so that the best of actors work in them.  Look at Anthony Hopkins acting in Thor!\n",
      "did you know that Dr Octopus swapped consciousness with spiderman?\n",
      "I never knew that!  I wonder what happened to Spiderman by doing it.\n",
      "Not sure. But it is Dr Oc in the superior spider man series. Weird...\n",
      "That is weird.  Maybe the writers left it for Spider man to become a bad guy.  Stan Lee probably had something in mind.  I always liked him. I especially liked that he had cameo roles in all of his movies.\n",
      "I always go into the movies looking for him. Always fun to see where they put him.\n",
      "I think one of my favorites was when he worked as a fedex guy delivering a package for tony Stank in iron man.\n",
      "That was good. Nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",

      "Hi are you a fan of Harry Potter?\n",
      "I am aware of HP. I know JK Rowling is the author.\n",
      "Nice.  Stephen Fry read all 7 Harry Potter audio books for the UK editions. I don't know who he is.\n",
      "I have not listened to the books, so I don't either. Hard to believe Rowling was turned down by 122 publishers.\n",
      "That's incredible!  Harry Potter was born on July 31st, 1980 and the entire series takes place throughout the 90s.  I didn't know that.\n",
      "I am surprised to hear this too. It was the most banned book so far in the 21st Century.\n",
      "Wow!  Harry Potter books were translated from British to American English.\n",
      "No wonder it has become so popular in the US. The books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide.\n",
      "That's incredible!  Robin Williams wanted to play Hagrid in the Harry Potter movies, but was turned down because J.K. Rowling and director Chris Columbus only wanted British and Irish actors.\n",
      "Oh, I've never heard that. That is pretty surprising. Almost as surprising as Rowling being the first billionaire to fall off the Forbes billionaire list because of charitable giving.\n",
      "Wow.  I would say kudos to her for doing that.  J.K. Rowling was asked to use her initials instead of her full name because her publishers were worried that boys wouldn't want to read a book written by a woman.  That sounds so absurd to me.\n",
      "I feel the same way. That is absurd that she was asked to do that. I've been to Universal and seen a bit of the HP attraction. Rowling can go there and tell them to change anything incorrect.\n",
      "That's interesting!  Do you like snakes at all?  I'm afraid I don't like them. lol\n",
      "No way! They are creepy! I guess I'd have to move to New Zealand to get away from them as there's no snakes there.\n",
      "I'll be joining you!  Crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to snakes and lizards.  Odd fact.\n",
      "google bought youtube for 1.65 billion \n",
      "Interesting.  There is a genus of flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey.  Yikes!\n",
      "Well I hope they don't live around me! It's funny that there are lizards without but they're not snakes.\n",
      "I will pass on those as well.  lol  it's been fun chatting!\n",
      "Thank you! It's been nice chatting with you too.\n",
      "Have a great night!\n",

      "Did you know Johnny Depp directed the 1997 film Brave? \n",
      "He's one of those multi-talented people. I still remember seeing him in Edward Scissorhands, but I didn't realize he only said 196 words in the whole movie\n",
      "Yeah, that was a good movie, I didn't know he spoke so little in the film. \n",
      "I guess that shows how well his acting was in itself. I also liked him in the 2005 remake of Willy Wonka, but Gene Wilder refused to watch the movie because he didn't want to be disappointed\n",
      "Interesting. Did you know there are no Walmarts in NYC? \n",
      "That's not surprising. I wonder if that's due more to space or to population. I wouldn't be surprised if it had to do with politics\n",
      "I think it was because the unions don't want them there. \n",
      "I can see that. Chicago's nickname as the \"windy city\" is thought to be about the wind but is based more on the politicians\n",
      "I'm not surprised. Politicans in Kentucky have to swear an oath that they've never participated in a duel. \n",
      "That probably originated decades ago, but I guess it can still be relevant. During the Middle Ages when Venice was successful, many thought their politicians were chosen by lottery\n",
      "I can believe that. Did you know that when you turn 100 in Japan the PM sends you a silver cup. \n",
      "Nowadays, people live so long that that venture could get expensive. No wonder they're looking into cheaper cups\n",
      "LOL, I'm not sure. But apparently the PM position doesn't even exist in  Australia's constitution.\n",
      "Which is strange since they were owned by England. I guess that's where the custom comes from\n",
      "Yeah, apparently it is just a custom. \n",
      "A radio station pretended to be Canadian PM Jean Chretien and pranked the Queen of England. Hopefully she had a good sense of humor about that\n",
      "This is hilarious. I'm sure she didn't take a good liking to that. \n",
      "I guess we may never know. the PM of the UK during WWI is the great-grandfather of the actress Helena Bonham Carter. She was in the Harry Potter movies\n",
      "Interesting. I never saw them. Did you? \n",
      "No, I haven't. Maybe one day. I would watch a movie about Dr. Seuss that Johnny Depp is producing. He may even be starring in it\n",
      "Yeah, I probably would too. I used to read Dr. Seuss when I was younger. \n",
      "And he's a good enough actor to possibly do the roll well. No wonder he has so many awards\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello - how are you doing today?\n",
      "Hello, I am doing good. How are you?  What do you think of countries having prime ministers?\n",
      "I'm doing good thanks for asking. I think it's different. What about you?\n",
      "It is different, I agree.  I am not sure how much power they have.  It seems like they can do a little more than a president can but I am not certain.\n",
      "I saw the president of the UK has a cat with a government title of chief mouser.\n",
      "Lol! Well, I can they can do a bit more if they can give title's to their pets!  \n",
      "I agree lol. The PM position of Australia isn't in the constitution and is only a custom. \n",
      "That could be scary for the prime minister.  At any time the public could decide they no longer like the custom.  In Canada however, the prime minister serves as long as the queen wants.\n",
      "That would be scary. When you turn 100 in Japan, the PM sends you a silver cup to celebrate.\n",
      "Do a lot of people turn a 100 in Japan?\n",
      "Apparently they do. They will need to start making cheaper silver cups lol.\n",
      "Hahaha!  Hey, check this out.  In Bulgaria their monarch died at age 49 during ww2 so his 6 year old son became leader.  For obvious reasons the people voted to end the monarchy soon after this and start a democracy.  Flash forward 58 years and the now 64 year old previous ruler ran for prime minister and them people voted him in!\n",
      "LOL! Did you know politicians in Kentucky must swear an oath that they've never participated in a duel before taking office?\n",
      "No I didn't! Even in this day and age they still have to do that?\n",
      "I guess so lol. Do you like Johnny Depp? \n",
      "I do like him.  I think he sometimes comes across as strange but on the flip side he is actually nice.  He takes his jack sparrow costume with him wherever he goes so he can visit kids in children's hospitals dressed in character.\n",
      "He's definitely strange, but a very good actor. He directed The Brave in 1997.\n",
      "I don't remember that movie.  Was it good?\n",
      "I've never seen it either. Johnny Depp only said 196 words in Edward Scissorhands.\n",
      "I did see that one and I liked it.  Did you know that he's related to Queen Elizabeth?\n",
      "It was great talking to you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello there, did you know that Barnaby Joyce was the deputy prime minister of Australia?\n",
      "No, but I do like Australia, from what I've heard about it. Is Barnaby Joyce in the news lately?\n",
      "In fact yes, he has been featured in many news articles regarding scandals that he has had.\n",
      "I guess he's not the lowest key Prime Minister you could get. I guess many politicians get in the news for unflattering circumstances now and then.\n",
      "I agree, although some other politicians have had it worse. Bob Hawke had many affairs, for example\n",
      "They're almost as flamboyant as Johnny Depp in those pirate movies.\n",
      "Yep. Ben Clifly would fall under the same category\n",
      "That's the first news I've heard of the prime minister of Australia. I've heard that in the UK there is a cat that lives in the Prime Minister's residence with chief mouser as his title, though!\n",
      "Really! I wish I could attain a title that easily\n",
      "Japan also has a Prime Minister. When you turn one hundred years old he sends you a silver cup.\n",
      "I do not think that he has sent that many silver cups then. In my opinion, Prime ministers are superior to presidents. \n",
      "Yes, politicians can be strange. They've outlawed Walmarts in New York City.\n",
      "They also split up simple oil after it became too big of a company. Do you think Trump is doing a good job governing America?\n",
      "I heard he's made more jobs and housing, but other than that, no. He's on social media too much.\n",
      "In my opinion, the Government shutdown was his fault. Speaking of politicians, did you know that Venice was successful due to its governing system?\n",
      "No, how did that work? I heard in Kentucky the politicians must swear by oath that they've never been in a duel, though.\n",
      "Really? I have also heard that President James Buchanan had a boyfriend. His boyfriend was referred as ' his better half'\n",
      "That's amazing! I heard Queen Elizabeth II was once successfully prank called by a radio station pretending to be Prime Minister of Canada Jean Chretien.\n",
      "That is a pretty good prank. I just wanted to point out that Johnny Depp directed the 1997 film ' the brave' I really enjoyed that film\n",
      "Yes, I've seen that! Johnny Depp is in a lot of movies I like! I wonder if he will ever be like Arnie and become an actor turned politician?\n",
      "I wonder. Johnny Depp only said 196 words in edward scissorhands. I find that quite fascinating.\n",
      "That is pretty cool! I don't remember him saying much. I can't wait for the upcoming Dr. Seuss movie he's going to be making!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you follow politics much?\n",
      "Yes, A Prime minister is the head of the state and executive branch of the government. He is the head of all states.\n",
      "Do you live in a country that has a prime minister?\n",
      "He gives advice to the council of ministers whenever they need it. He plan the schemes for the welfare of the nation and people.\n",
      "That's very interesting. Is there a prime minister of your country?\n",
      "Do you live in a country has prime minister ?\n",
      "No, my country has a president. What about yours?\n",
      "My country has a president.\n",
      "My country has one too. I read about politics and the president in my country a lot. Do you read about the politics of your country?\n",
      "Yes, the president has executive power in day to day life. He creates welfare schemes for the nation and people.\n",
      "That's great! It sounds like your President has a good plan for the country. Does he have people in the government to help him?\n",
      "Surely. Before taking any decision he surely has meetings with experts and the opposition party leader to ask their opinions.\n",
      "You are right. In politics, it is best when both parties talk to each other and agree. Does your country's government agree a lot, or argue a lot?\n",
      "It is the President's duty to explain the current situation to the opposition party members. Only then will he take the necessary steps.\n",
      "Your President sounds like a strong leader. There is a lot of arguing in politics with my country's President.\n",
      "The President thinks only of the welfare of the nation and the people. People are confident in his ability to govern.\n",
      "The President sounds like a very good man who thinks of his people, not just himself. He is an inspiring politician.\n",
      "In democratic countries, politicians seek the positions in the government through elections.\n",
      "Democratic elections give the people a chance to choose who they want leading them. Do you live in a democratic country?\n",
      "Yes, the government is for the people. People enjoy real power by casting their vote. Politicians can canvas the people to seek their vote.\n",
      "I am glad to hear you live in a country with a good President and a good government. Voting for politicians is a good way to say what you think. It was good talking to you.\n",

      "Mission Impossible is a great movie I really like it\n",
      "I actually haven't seen any of them, but one of my friends really liked Fallout\n",
      "I thought it was good, Tom Cruise is a great actor, he makes the franchise come to life\n",
      "Have you seen him in The Last Samurai? He spent two years learning swordplay and Japanese for that role\n",
      "I thought that was a great movie as well and really? Looks like he takes his roles in movies real serious. I guess that's why he earns that much money.\n",
      "That's probably why he does his roles so well. The term \"The Last Samurai\" is actually a plural reference to a clan though, not just one character\n",
      "Yeah that makes sense, did you heard about the $10 million bunker he has?\n",
      "The one he bought to protect himself from aliens?\n",
      "Yeah the same one, expensive but it must be alien proof \n",
      "He must have the money despite the fact that Seinfeld has a higher net worth\n",
      "He does? Well Tom Cruise will eventually come on top, he has a lot more movies planned in the future. I don't know about Seinfeld.\n",
      "What's interesting is that Tom Cruise is actually the fourth generation in his family with that name\n",
      "He is? I wonder if there are any other actors as well, \n",
      "Probably a few. The guy who invented the hover board is named Tom Kruse, and Tom Cruise actually threatened him for using the name\n",
      "Well it is also his name lol, that is kind of funny and could get a lot of people confused\n",
      "Did you ever hear about the guys who pulled off a heist similar to that in Mission Impossible?\n",
      "No, did they have success? thats awesome, also really risky\n",
      "They were successful. As successful as Mission Impossible II was for Tom Cruise since he made $75 million just for that movie\n",
      "Thats a lot of money, did you know he scaled the tallest building in the filming of Mission Impossible 4!\n",
      "And when he did it, he wasn't wearing safety equipment!\n",
      "Wow and there's also the scene on the side of the airplane at 5,000 feet! That just gives me the creeps. I think I had enough of action for one day. It's been great chatting with you but I'm going to call it a night.\n",
      "Have a good evening!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a fan of Tom Cruise? \n",
      "I do like some of his movies.\n",
      "Did you know Seinfeld is worth more than Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks combined? \n",
      "I can believe that.  I first remember Cruise when I saw his movie Risky Business back in 1983.\n",
      "Hahaha, I love that movie. I think it is one of his best. \n",
      "I loved it.  Then of course there came Top Gun and then Coctail in 1988.  That soundtrack was huge that summer, which was the summer before my senior high school year.\n",
      "Cocktail was great too. It made me want to bartend. \n",
      "lol Yes me too!  Aladdin's face was based on Tom Cruise.  I never knew that. haha\n",
      "I didn't know that. Well, apparently he has an underground bunker too. \n",
      "Oh wow.  Wonder what that's all about?  The municipal government of Paris passed a resolution to prohibit Tom Cruise from becoming an honorary citizen of the city.\n",
      "Well apparently it is to hide from aliens. \n",
      "Oh boy lol  Tom hung off the side of an airplane that was soaring at 5,000 feet for the new Mission Impossible movie.\n",
      "That is pretty cool. I heard about that. He likes to do his own stunts. \n",
      "Yes I've heard that too.  The Last Samurai is plural and refers to the last clan of Samurai and not just Tom Cruise's character in the movie.\n",
      "Interesting. Did you see that movie? I saw it.\n",
      "I actually haven't seen it.  Is it good?\n",
      "It is only ok. I would recommend other movies over that any day. \n",
      "Ok lol  Did you know Mission Impossible was first a tv show?\n",
      "Yeah, I did. The movie isn't bad either. Well, nice chatting with you!\n",
      "Leonard Nimoy played a role in that tv show.  Nice chatting with you too!\n",
      "Interesting! Take it easy!\n",

      "Hi there, do you like Disney movies?\n",
      "Hi, I love Disney movies!  I think Disney in general is great.  When you think about it being founded back in 1923 and it is still going strong, it's amazing.\n",
      "I know, they have become a dynasty. Do you know what the name of the character minnie mouse is. The real name?\n",
      "I use to know it. I honestly can't think of it off the top of my head. What is it?\n",
      "It is Minerva Mouse, I like Minnie better\n",
      "I do too. It goes better with Mickey.  Speaking of, did you know there's a whole thing about finding the hidden mickey mouse images in disney stuff?\n",
      "I did not but now I will be looking for that. Do you know how the name of wall-e came about?\n",
      "Can't say that i do. Honestly, I've never thought about it. I just assumed it was because it's cute.\n",
      "It was in honor of Walter Elias DIsney apparently\n",
      "That is really cool! Disney does such interesting stuff right there in plain sight of everyone but at the same time it's hidden if that makes sense.  Have you ever seen the movie Flubber?  I heard they actually consulted with Bill Nye about it.\n",
      "That is cool, Bill seems to be everywhere. And they rendered the Big Hero 6 with a 55000 core computer\n",
      "Impressive!  Have you seen Beauty and the Beast?  I've seen the animated film but not the live action one with Emma Watson.\n",
      "I actually saw it and it was pretty well realized. In the Chinese version of the movie, Jackie CHan was the voice of the Beast\n",
      "I love the theme song to it.  I heard that Celine Dion didn't really want to do it at first. i bet she is glad she did!\n",
      "I am sure she is. And the music was composed by the same man that did it for other movies such as Pocahontas, little mermaid and many others\n",
      "Whoever that man is he is very talented. All of those movies had great songs!  Have you ever seen the tv series beauty and the beast?\n",
      "Yes, the one with Linda Hamilton and Ron Pearlman right?\n",
      "That's the one! That was a good show!  But the live action movie I was talking about earlier is one of the most expensive movies ever made.\n",
      "Wow, I can see why though. I have heard animations can be very expensive. \n",
      "I've heard that too.  Hey, what do you think of Morgan Freeman?  I never knew until recently that he had been on the electric company back in the 70s!\n",
      "I did not know that either but I do like him as an actor. It was really nice chatting with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, do you like Walt Disney?\n",
      "I like Disney!  How about you!\n",
      "I do as well. Did you know Minnie Mouse's name is short for Minerva Mouse?\n",
      "I never knew that!  The Disney channel only runs commericals that are for it's own shows and Disney products!\n",
      "That's very cool. There is a subculture dedicated to finding hidden Mickey Mouse images throughout Disney things.\n",
      "Interesting!  Disney makes about $1,110 per second!  Wish I could do that!\n",
      "Wow that's a lot of money! Disney's big hero 6 was rendered using a 55,000 core supercomputer.\n",
      "Sounds impressive!  Walt Disney and Salvador Dali collarborated on a short film called Destino in 1945.\n",
      "That's very cool. Did you know Bill Nye was a science consultant for Disney's Flubber movie?\n",
      "I had no idea!  Interesting!  Walt Disney got fired from his job at a local newspaper for not being creative enough. lol\n",
      "Interesting. I saw Pixar named Wall-E as a tip of the hat to Walt Disney.\n",
      "I had no idea!  Did you like Beauty and the Beast?\n",
      "I did like it. What about you?\n",
      "I did!  It grossed over $1.2 billion dollars worldwide!\n",
      "Wow! Jackie Chan provided the speaking and singing voice of the beast in the Chinese version of Beauty and the Beast.\n",
      "Wow.  I never knoew that.  It had a budget of around $255 million, which made it one of the most expensive movies ever made.  Glad they recouped their money.\n",
      "I agree. The boy from Jumanji was the voice of Chip.\n",
      "Interesting.  Beauty and the Beast was the first animated movie to be nominated in the best picture category at the Oscars.\n",
      "That's pretty cool. I think Celine Dion sings the theme song for the movie.\n",
      "Yes!  I believe you are correct.  The triplets in the movie are named the Bimbette sisters.  That's your useless fact of the day.  lol\n",
      "It was good talking to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a fan of disney movies\n",
      "I am a Disney fan. What about you?\n",
      "I love Disney, which is your favorite?\n",
      "Beauty and the Beast is one of my all time favorites. It's hard to imagine that it came out in 1991. I've seen the show at WDW a few times. It's fun.\n",
      "For sure! My wife is in love with that movie. I liked it too. I can't believe it came out that long ago!\n",
      "Same here. The same man composed the music to the Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast Aladdin and more!\n",
      "Wow, that guy is so talented!\n",
      "Yes, he even wrote music for Pocahontas, Hunchback of Norte Dame and Hercules.\n",
      "This guy is just writing his own paychecks lol. Did you know Jackie Chan did some voice work on china's version of beauty and beast, the live action one\n",
      "No, I did not even know such a version even existed.\n",
      "me neither that would be interesting to see lol. Celine Dion launched her career by agreeing to sing the theme song to beauty and the beast\n",
      "Oh I did not know that. I don't care for her at all. Did you know Beauty and the Beast was the first animated movie to be nominated in the best picture category at the Oscars?\n",
      "wow, that is an amazing feat! I think that set the tone for more to come. Are you a morgan freeman fan, I think he has been in a disney movie or two\n",
      "Yes, he is quite an actor. I really can not believe he was born in 1937!\n",
      "He seems so much younger than that wow, I can't believe it either! I loved the movie se7en, I just watched it last month, crazy ending!\n",
      "I have not heard of that one. One of my favorites was Driving Miss Daisy.\n",
      "I recommend it, thriller for sure! I have actually never seen that one, but have only heard great things about it\n",
      "Did you know that Morgan Freeman is also a beekeeper?\n",
      "no way, I wouldn't put it past him. I heard he got his start playing a singing vampire obsessed with vegetables on the electric company in the 70s\n",
      "Oh, that's crazy. I've never heard that before. Well, it was nice chatting today. Have a good day!\n",
      "You too, have a great weekend!\n",

      "I have always enjoyed watching Walt Disney movies - that studio makes great movies.\n",
      "I love me some disney movies! Which is your favorite?\n",
      "Beauty and the Beast was a great one!  \n",
      "For sure! Did you know jackie chan was a voice in the chinese version?\n",
      "I did not.  It grossed over 1.2 billion worldwide so it had to have been popular all over the globe\n",
      "I bet. Did you know the boy from jumani is the voice of chip? He does it all i guess!\n",
      "That is cool.  I knew that Celine Dion sang the theme which helped launch her into stardom.\n",
      "That is awesome, I wish Morgan Freeman had a role in one of these movies, he is awesome!\n",
      "Yes he was great in Driving Miss Daisy - that was a great movie.\n",
      "How about the movie se7en, now that was a great movie!\n",
      "Yes - it might not have been as good if Brad Pitt and Freeman had not insisted on the ending.\n",
      "right, crazy ending to say the least. It would have been better with samuel l jackson in it. He was mentored by Freeman.\n",
      "That is cool.  Morgan Freeman has been nominated and won more awards than the total number of movies he has starred in.  That is crazy.\n",
      "That is so crazy, he definitely is a great actor. I did hear maybe he dated his niece one time or something like that.\n",
      "I had never heard that.  I knew he once played a singing vampire who was obsessed with vegetables - that is rather kooky!\n",
      "That is crazy to hear! He golfs one handed even!\n",
      "Yes - he injured his left hand in a car accident - that was sad\n",
      "For sure, at least his voice wasn't injured.\n",
      "Yes.  Did you see him in the shawshank redemption?  That movie was very moving.\n",
      "Loved the movie! Good chatting with you!\n",
      "Watch Invictus too!  Great one!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Hello, do you like Disney?\n",
      "Yes, I do like Disney. They have done many great films and have some great theme parks.\n",
      "Do you know the original Disney is in California and not Florida?\n",
      "I've been to both. Disneyworld is more fun, but a lot bigger. A bit overwhelming in that way.\n",
      "That's cool!  I've only gone to the one in FLorida.  I heard that there is a whole subculture dedicated to finding hidden mickey mouse images around Disney parks.\n",
      "Yeah, Disney is quite clever and creative. They do a lot to keep the fans intrigued. I would say that Disney invests for the long term. They believe in quality.\n",
      "Yes they do!  have you watched any movies created by Disney?  Bill Nye was a science consultant for the movie Flubber.\n",
      "I never saw Flubber, though I think it was made a couple time. Why Bill Nye? I figure there must be others that know more than he does. \n",
      "I would think so also, but one of my favorite Disney movies is Beauty and the Beast.\n",
      "I saw that a long time ago. Great songs! It probably won many awards.\n",
      "Yes!  The film grossed over $1.2 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing live-action musical film.\n",
      "Hm. I thought it was animation. I guess you mean the remake? I never saw that. It was probably great as well. \n",
      "Yep, in 2017 they remade Beauty and the Beast.  Celine Dion reluctantly agreed to sing the theme to Beauty and the Beast, but doing so really put her on the map!\n",
      "I guess she was perfect for the song. She has a great voice. I wonder why she was reluctant.\n",
      "I agree, she has a great voice.  One American actor I really like is Morgan Freeman.  \n",
      "He has a great voice. His narration is spot on. A lot of gravitas. I loved him in Batman.\n",
      "The Dark Knight was good!  Morgan is a great guy, he started mentoring Samuel L. Jackson in his early acting career. \n",
      "I did not know that! He really is a great guy off screen too then. I hope he's around for a long time.\n",
      "So do I!  I guess in 2008 Morgan Freeman got in a car accident.  Due to nerve damage in his left hand, he plays golf one-handed!\n",
      "He plays one-handed golf? LOL. I guess the man loves his golf.\n",
      "Yes that is dedication!  Have a good day!\n",
      "Thanks! You too!\n",
      "Thank you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi how are you doing? Do you like morgan freeman?\n",
      "Yeah, just saw him the latest Disney rendition of The Nutcracker.  Did you see that?\n",
      "no, i did not. what role did he play?\n",
      "He played the godfather.  Movie was ok.  Kind of a Alice in Wonderland meets Cirque du Soleil feel.  And per Disney's usual... it had a strong female lead. Morgan Freeman's been in some better stuff.\n",
      "yeah, people love him so he gets cast a lot. i suppose my favorite film of his is shawshank. that was great. which film of his do you like?\n",
      "OMG!  Shawshank is my favorite.  Loved his character Red.\n",
      "Yes, i think that originally Brad Pitt was supposed to be dufresne. i though the chemistry between morgan and tim was great.\n",
      "Yeah, can't see anyone by Tim Robbins in that role.  Also liked him in Million Dollar Baby.  (Spoiler alert). Movie made me cry though.\n",
      "Yeah, he really brings a gravitas to any role. He was on TV originally. on the electric company.\n",
      "I think I remember that!  Vaguely remember him dancing in a kind of knitted sweater.  Amazing how he started on that kids show to become an Academy Award winning actor!\n",
      "yeah, he loved acting. i think he was in the military, then went to college to study acting. interesting guy.\n",
      "Love his voice.  Surprised he hasn't done more voice acting for cartoons.  Think he voices a character in the Lego movie.  Is that a Disney flick?\n",
      "yes, he was in the batman movies, maybe they wanted him to voice a character like that? He would do great voices for animation.\n",
      "Considering he just did a Disney movie I'd figure they'd want to utilize his skills.  Disney's got money to spend.  Heard the company makes about $1,110 per second!\n",
      "yes, i wish i could buy their stock. they will always be a money maker. .they make quality films and the theme parks are great.\n",
      "Yeah, my kids are always watching some Disney movie.  My daughter loves the live action Beauty and the Beast.  \n",
      "Really? is it better than the animated version? the songs were great in that?\n",
      "They used the same songs.  I personally liked the animated version better.  Think what appeals to my daughter is Emma Watson.  She also love Harry Potter movies.\n",
      "Yes, she is a talented actress. I bet she did a great job. Anyway, thanks for the chat.\n",
      "It has a solid cast overall.  Hope you get to catch it some time.\n",
      "Have a good day! Talk to you soon, Im sure.\n",
      "Thanks!  See you around.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hello do you like disney?\n",
      "Hi! There are things about Disney that I like, and some that I don't like. What about you?\n",
      "Yeah i love disney,  did you know minnie mouse is actually short for minerva?\n",
      "Isn't Minerva some sort of Greek goddess? I didn't know that Minnie got her name from the Greek.\n",
      "Yes I think so.  Have any favorite disney movies?\n",
      "I haven't seen any Disney movies in a while. I think I liked Escape to Witch Mountain when I was a kid. I also like Fantasia.\n",
      "I never seen escape from witch mountain,  I did like fantasia though,  it was also kinda creepy lol when I was a kid I didnt appreciate that the whole movie was music. \n",
      "The movie was a breakthrough for its time. I don't know how many work-hours it took, but it was an accomplishment. \n",
      "Yeah crazy.  do you remember beauty and the beasts? \n",
      "Oh, yeah. I remember that film. Tons of tunes came out of that film. Tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme. Very catchy. Probably done on computer?\n",
      "Yeah really good songs, I recently learned that jackie chan provided the beasts voic ein the chinese version lol\n",
      "That guy is amazingly talented! He is quite an entertainer.\n",
      "yeah he is amazing and super funny\n",
      "Have you seen the movie Big Hero 6? It  was rendered using a 55,000-core supercomputer. I expect more amazing movies to come out made possible only by computers.\n",
      "That movie was awesome.  I had no idea it took so much power to make that movie\n",
      "I should see it then. I didn't know Celine Dion did the theme for Beauty and the Beast.\n",
      "Oh really,  I thought it was Angela Lansbury?\n",
      "I think she played a character who also sang it. Maybe there is a radio release version, and Celine did that.\n",
      "oh I see.  That makes sense. the same man composed music to little mermaid,  beauty and the beast,  aladdin,  pocahontas,  hunchback of notre dame,  and hercules.  Thats awesome. \n",
      "Alan Menken, I think. Quite talented, good sense of melody. And probably pretty rich at this point. \n",
      "Yeah seriously.  lol its been great talking to you. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, I did not know that Jackie Chan acted in Beauty and Beast!\n",
      "Yes, He provided speaking and singing voice in chinese version.\n",
      "I am listening to the song as we chat. \n",
      "Very nice! The Walt Disney company is also know as simply disney\n",
      "That is true. Recently, I went to the Walt Disney Museum and it was a big blessing for Walt to have an imaginative mind.\n",
      "It is the world largest independent media in terms of revenue. The company was found by Walt and Roy O.\n",
      "Even, Bill Nye the Science guy was a consultant for the movie Flubber! Isn't that crazy?\n",
      "Yes, Very crazy it very full fo humor to watch flubber.\n",
      "Maybe, Bill Nye had to add more effect with more science experiments to create flubber.\n",
      "Freeman has served narrator, commentator for numerous programs and television shows.\n",
      "Well, he was nominated and won a lot of rewards.\n",
      "Yes. He played all his role very well and multi talented person he is.\n",
      "One example would be his role as a singing vampire who loved vegetables.\n",
      "You watched the movie \"The chronicles of Narnia\" ?\n",
      "Yes I did! I did not watch the rest of the sequences. However, the first movie was extroardinary.\n",
      "Yes, Kids are loved to watch it. Many animated movie are taken by Walt Disney.\n",
      "I forgot about that! This movie was not animated, but the effects were great, thanks to Walt Disney's talent.\n",
      "Some scenes are Graphical, Its very nice to see this kind of movies again.\n",
      "The Nutcracker had some mild peril. However, as this movie moves on from generation to generation, this became a musical and a family-friendly movie.\n",
      "It is fantasy story and for every chistmas time entertainment.\n",
      "This gives a great feeling to look forward to.\n",
      "Very happy to chat with you. Have a great day.\n",
      "Thank you, and you do the same.\n",
      "All the best.\n",
      "Yes, indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you see the Disney Nutcracker?\n",
      "Yes,  I did.  Do you like Disney?\n",
      "I love Disney!  It really brings out my inner child!\n",
      "yeah same.  What are some of your favorite disney movies?\n",
      "I loved the cartoon Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, Lion King, some of those iconic cartoons from when I was growing up\n",
      "Yeah same!  I really like little mermaid,  lion king,  aladdin, frozen, moana.  \n",
      "Yeah.  There is still stuff I didnt know, like Minnie's real name is Minerva.\n",
      "me either,  I never knew it was short for anything!  Did you know the disney channel doesnt accept outside ads?\n",
      "I didnt.  I guess I never noticed all of their ads were internally related.\n",
      "Yeah me either.  Although,  I do not watch the Disney channel much.  Only really the movies.  Did you know walt disney was fired from his newspaper job for not being more creative?  lol ironic. \n",
      "Yeah, he really showed them.  His work will live on forever.  Just with the parks alone\n",
      "They are putting a new area in Disneyland in California.  Star wars land I believe its called!\n",
      "Wow, that would be neat to see.  I have watched Disney World in Orlando develop over the years.\n",
      "Thats cool,  I haven't been to that one in years!  I mostly go to the CA one.  \n",
      "It has been a good 5 for me, but I live an hour away, so its not a huge trip.\n",
      "Ah cool!  You should go more often then lol Did you see the most recent Beauty and the Beast? \n",
      "I havent.  I really want to though.  Ill have to see if it is on netflix.\n",
      "It was ok.  I think it was weird that Belle had a british accent even though she was from france lol \n",
      "I never though of that part.  I guess in the cartoon she doesnt have one at all.\n",
      "Yeah,  the cartoons almost no one has an accent. \n",
      "Except Lumiere.  He is the only one.  And come to think of it the teapot had a british one in the cartoon too.\n",
      "lol weird.  Been great chatting with you! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey how's it going? Did you watch the Oscars this year? They gave out a set of 24 awards for many accomplishments in the film industry.\n",
      "I did not watch this year but I do know some of my favorite actors have previously won. Daniel Day Lewis is the only actor to win 3 times.\n",
      "Yeah he's a great actor. The movie blazing saddles was nominated for three Oscars!\n",
      "Wow! I did not know that. Also surprising, is Eminem has more Oscars than DeCaprio, Depp, Lucas, Murray and WIll Smith combined. \n",
      "That is very hard to believe. And he's not even an actor, well I guess he is. Walt Disney to this day holds the record for most Oscars won by a man. Now that makes sense.\n",
      "I heard that he has 22 Oscars under his name. He deserves it. I cannot think of more iconic film than Disney.\n",
      "Totally agree with you. The Oscars themselves were even nominated for nine Emmys in 2013!\n",
      "How funny. I wonder if they won any. When it comes to Oscars I do not think anyone has been nominated more than Meryl Streep. Often described as the \"best actress of her generation.\"\n",
      "Yeah she really is a great actress. She even has an actress daughter who plays the FBI agent on Mr. robot.\n",
      "Meryl Streep has been nominated for 21 Academy Awards, only won three. She was nominated for 31 Golden Globe nomination, won eight.\n",
      "Incredible! Since she's only won three times she is in second place for most awards.\n",
      "Have you ever seen the movie Julie & Julia with Meryl Streep? It is so great  and makes me very hungry each time I watch it\n",
      "I don't think I've seen it but I will add it to my list. Another good actress is Emma Watson. I thought she was so good in the Harry Potter series.\n",
      "I love the Harry Potter films. I think it is adorable that the director of Prisoner of Azkaban made the actors write essays about their characters. Emma wrote 16 pages, Daniel Radcliffe turned in a page and Rupert Grint forgot his.\n",
      "That is hilarious! Emma almost considered not playing Hermione in The Half Blood Prince. That would have been devastating for the series.\n",
      "I am so glad that she decided to continue. She said she could not watch someone else play the role and I am not sure if I could either.\n",
      "Yes I agree with her. Emma is also a certified yoga teacher! I would love to take her class.\n",
      "Me too. I think she would be fantastic at it. I was surprised to find out that her and Margot Robbie were both born in 1990. They do not seem like the same age.\n",
      "Yeah I agree that is surprising for sure. Sounds like she had some star studded classmates at the dragon school too! Well it was really nice getting the chance to talk with you!\n",
      "It has been nice talking with you as well. Make sure to watch lots of great movies and especially Julie & Julia. One of the actors in the film, Stanley Tucci, is a great cook and taught Meryl Streep.\n",
      "Definitely. Thanks!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you watch the academy awards regularly?\n",
      "I don't, I just kind of think all the award shows are somewhat of a joke and people don't credit they are owed. I mean its crazy the Eminem has won more Oscars than all of those actors combined.\n",
      "I did not know that Eminem has won many Oscars.\n",
      "Neither did I. Not that he isn't a good rapper, just shocks me he would win so many especially with what a lot of his lyrics stand for. I am also surprised that the Oscars were nominated 9 times at the emmys, I really didn't know that was possible.\n",
      "He is not even officially in the film industry.\n",
      "I know. Blazing Saddles won 3 times, I have no idea what movie that even is lol. I guess I have some investigating to do.\n",
      "Me too.  leonardo decaprio is a real actor yet eminem has won more awards. \n",
      "I agree, all of the actors listed are definitely more deserving. Like Meryl Streep, I mean she only won 3 times but at least was recognized for her talent multiple times.  \n",
      "You are right.  I like Meryl Streep.  I think she should get more Oscars than Eminem.\n",
      "I agree. How do you like Emma Watson? From what I have seen people love her or hate her, I think especially to when she speaks on certain subjects.\n",
      "I do not follow her.  I know that she was in Harry Potter films.\n",
      "I think thats what most people know her from \n",
      "She was in the movie because she wrote a long essay compared to the other two candidates.\n",
      "She really wanted the role and was dedicated to it by her choice to come back and continue to play the character when she almost left. \n",
      "She did not want other people to play the role and so she decided to stay.\n",
      "It was a good choice. Switching a main character can ruin the movie\n",
      "I would think so.\n",
      "I did like her in Beauty and the Beast. Its on Netflix if you have access. Brings back memories of childhood\n",
      "I like girly movies.  Was she the voice in beauty and the beast?\n",
      "Its actually the more modern version, its not a cartoon so she plays a real human. \n",
      "Oh okay, I have never seen it.  I saw the cartoon version of beauty and the beast.\n",
      "Its either from 2017 or 2018. Netflix has it if you or anyone has access to it. \n",
      "Thank you for your info.  Nice talking to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello hows it going?  do you watch the academy awards?\n",
      "Hi, I haven't have you?  Did you hear that Daniel Day-Lewis is the only actor to win best actor at the oscars 3 times?\n",
      "Nice,  I read that somewhere!  I also read Blazing saddles was nominated for 3 oscars.  I cant remember which movie that is lol \n",
      "Walt Disney holds the record for most oscars with 22.  That doesn't seem surprising though.\n",
      "Disney is amazing!  I am a huge disney fan,  so yeah I love their movies!\n",
      "Eminem has done well with more oscars than Dicaprio, depp, smith, lucas, and murray combined.\n",
      "Wow,  thats interesting.  For what ?\n",
      "If you watch Golden Globes, interestingly Streep has won 31 nominations, eight more than any actor\n",
      "Nice.  good for her!  she is awesome!\n",
      "She also won three Primetime Emmy Awards too\n",
      "wow i didnt know Meryl streeps daughter is in Mr. Robot!  Thats cool. \n",
      "Interestingly, Stanly tucci is an incredible cook and made Meryl Streep cook with him to prepare for julie and julia;  That was a fun movie by the way.\n",
      "That is awesome!  Having stanley tucci teach you how to cook lol while making a movie,  while getting paid lol \n",
      "Streeps first film role was actually a sports movie.\n",
      "I saw that.  Did you know Emma Watson went to dragon school,  I know its really prestigious n all,  but to me it sounds like a place where you train dragons and that would be amazing! \n",
      "Before the filming of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the director alfonso Cuaron had Daniel Radcliffe and other actors write essays about their characters with Watson pumping out a 16 page essay and Radcliffe one page\n",
      "Yeah I heard that before,  of course she would lol \n",
      "Watson actually was considering not playing hermione but changed her mind saying she couldn't watch someone else play it in the Half Blood Prince\n",
      "I wouldve been heart broken if she didnt play it.  Did you know Emma and Margot Robbie are the same age? thats a trip! \n",
      "Sounds like they were both born in 1990 then.  Watson had been born in Paris and raised in Oxfordshire.\n",
      "Nice.  Thats awesome.  its been fun chatting.  have a good one. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi did you ever play with Nintendo?\n",
      "Hi there yes I like Nintendo and play it. DO you know how long it has been around?\n",
      "It has been for a long time, over 100 years and started as a playing card company\n",
      "Yeah they have come a long way. They were also a toy company once\n",
      "That is true. They produced a knock off lego once\n",
      "Wow, they have tried their hand on everything it seems, smart business people\n",
      "Very true. And they also own the Seattle Mariners. Good investment seems\n",
      "Wow, good for them. They once released a console just for Pokemon\n",
      "Wow that is dedication. How about the XBox?\n",
      "I use it sometimes too. They are nice to make consoles for quadriplegics, that is thoughtful\n",
      "That is true. The original one made creepy noise if it was on for too long\n",
      "wow I would not have liked that. A guy once spent $2600 in a carnival in hopes to win an xbox and won a banana with dreadlocks\n",
      "wow that is not money well spent. The army now is using xbox 360 controllers to fly spy planes\n",
      "Wow pretty cool. do you know what video games used to be called?\n",
      "Yeah they had a funky name like cathode ray tube amusement devices\n",
      "Wow that is a long name, I am happy they changed it over to just video games\n",
      "Me too. Do you know who did the voice of Woody in video games?\n",
      "I think it is Jim Hanks the brother of Tom Hanks\n",
      "Yeah I guess talent runs in the family. Do you now how many hours of video games we play in a week as a planet?\n",
      "Hmm I am not sure, How do you even calculate that to be honest?\n",
      "Yeah I am not sure but a game designer calculated it to be 3 billion hours a week\n",
      "Wow that is mind blowing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, do you play nintendo?\n",
      "I do sometimes. Do you?  Did you know that the company is over a 100 years old?\n",
      "I did not know that. I used to play it with my kids. They really liked it.  Nintendo is one of the world's largest video game companies\n",
      "They used to be a toy company.  They made playing cards and a type of legos among others.\n",
      "huh, thats neat to know. I wonder what a love hotel is?\n",
      "I haven't heard of that before.  Is that a game?\n",
      "No, it is something Nintendo tried back in the day!\n",
      "Really?!  I guess Nintendo has done it all!  I wonder where the name Nintendo comes from.  I mean, the founder's last name is Yamauchi.\n",
      "no idea. Have you ever heard of this game? F-zero x?\n",
      "I think I have. I think it's a racing game.\n",
      "thats what it says. first racing game to run at 60 frames per second. I had never heard of it.\n",
      "It must be from years back.  Did you know that Nintendo owns the Seattle Mariners?\n",
      "No! It's crazy how these things end up! did you know the Xbox is made by microsoft?\n",
      "I do know that.  I think the Xbox is more serious than Nintendo. The army uses them to fly uav spy planes.\n",
      "Wow! A canadian teenager once settled out of court and exchanged his domain name mikerowesoft.com for an xbox and games from microsoft\n",
      "See, microsoft is serious about itself and it's name!  If i was the teenager though I would have wanted cash.\n",
      "me too. This is crazy though. A man spent $2600 on a carnival game to win an xbox and instead won a banana with dreadlocks\n",
      "That is crazy! You could buy an xbox for a whole lot less!  Did you know that South Korea has laws on how late at night kids can play video games?\n",
      "no! How late? do you know?\n",
      "I do.  They can't play past midnight.\n",
      "Wow! Do you know what happens if they play after midnight? Are they like Gremlins?\n",
      "I don't know. I guess they get into some kind of legal trouble because it's a law there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You play video games?\n",
      "Heck yeah, Playstation gamer here\n",
      "Cool, haven't really played since the Xbox original... LOL\n",
      "Not even nintendo?\n",
      "oh yeah... i do play wii ocassionally\n",
      "Do you play Splat on Wii or Wii Sports on Nintendo?\n",
      "wii sports\n",
      "I think my first nintendon was in mid 80s\n",
      "oh yeah? I remember my parents getting pong... LOL\n",
      "I had an atari that I played video games on before that\n",
      "Nice... had one of those too!  You ever have nintendo 64?\n",
      "I did but I didn't really play it all that much, my brothers did though.\n",
      "Cool, i used to play splinter cell on the xbox a lot!\n",
      "I had a sega genesis video game system but never an Xbox\n",
      "Could you imagine the US passing the law like south korea where kids under the age of 16 could not play past midnight?\n",
      "I have a rule similar to that in my house...lol\n",
      "Very smart... hada step son that i tried to implement that on... but his mother never supported me... he would sometimes play for 18 hours straight!\n",
      "wow....the video game industry must have made a lot of money off him\n",
      "yeah for sure!  He was definitely part of that three billion hours of video games a week!\n",
      "Do you watch the ratings on video games before buying them for your stepson?\n",
      "i used to... but that became a losing battle too\n",
      "My favorite game of all time is Atari's Chuck E Cheese game\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you ever played Mario Kart?\n",
      "Never. What's it like? I know there were six games released for consoles.\n",
      "Its a racing game, its actually pretty good, there is actually an amusement park that has things like mario kart.\n",
      "Awesome. I know it's popular. Best ever in terms of racing game revenue right?\n",
      "Im not sure, but the last series sold over 100 million copies, my little brother bought it and I played it with him\n",
      "Wow. Cool. Did you know it's illegal for kids 16 and under to play video games in South Korea past 12 at night?\n",
      "I didnt know that, that's unfortunate for the kids\n",
      "That really is odd. It was added that we play three billion hours of video game every week worldwide somehow.\n",
      "There are some serious gamers out there, did you know that video games were called cathode ray tube amusement devices?\n",
      "Ah didnt know. Nintendo owns the Seattle Mariners. I didn't know that, did you? That's nuts.\n",
      "I didnt know that, its a fun fact that I will definetely use next time I gather with friends. \n",
      "Yeah. There is this app that lets you get food directly to your seat also.\n",
      "I might try out the app, and play Mario Kart with fiends as well. \n",
      "Yeah. Nintendo released a handheld console just for pokemon back in 2001, It was real popular during that era.\n",
      "I loved to play Pokemon, did you ever played the game or watched the series?\n",
      "I watched the series, but didn't play the game. Do you know Nintendo is over 100 years old?\n",
      "I didnt know its over 100 years old, I wonder how the games from that time look like.\n",
      "Well, they started out as a playing card company.\n",
      "Oh, I see, I didnt know it was a Japanese multinational company, I thought it was American. \n",
      "Yeah, it's Japanese. In fact, it has become their third most-valuable company with over 85 billion dollars.\n",
      "I can see why, as they have great games.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "I'm great! How are you? Do you play video games?\n",
      "I am well. I used to play video games but gave them up when I got married. Do you??\n",
      "I used to play them, but not much now. The military used to call video games \"cathode ray tube amusement devices.\"\n",
      "You don't call them that? It just rolls off the tongue...\n",
      "I guess the military thought it would make them sound serious. Nintendo is over 100 years old. It started as a playing card company.\n",
      "If you go to Austin, you can play a real life mario cart!\n",
      "That sounds like fun! I bet Waterloo Labs had fun making that! Mario Kart Wii is the best selling racing game ever.\n",
      "That is a little surprising. I would have thought gran prix or something like that.... I bet Logic would beat you in Mario Kart!\n",
      "Probably. He won all those battles against different rappers. He must be good.\n",
      "Or rappers are not good at Mario Kart! Coins make you go faster and stop you from spinning out.\n",
      "It's interesting that the items are not random but meant to balance out power among players. \n",
      "I did not know that. Nintendo produced knock off legos when they were a toy company. Weird.\n",
      "The company tried many things, but video games made them. They came into the market just after the big crash in 1983. They released a handheld for Pokemon.\n",
      "Nintendo owns the Seattle Mariners?!?!?! Huh?\n",
      "They are a huge company. Nintendo of America is in Seattle. I don't think they have any love hotels there though.\n",
      "I used to love playing Legend of Zelda. Did you play that one?\n",
      "Never played Zelda. Very popular though. A big part of popular culture. Did you know that Jim Hanks does Woody's voice in video games? I guess Tom is too busy.\n",
      "Someone estimates that we play 3 billion hours of video games every week? That's too much...\n",
      "Video games have replaced television as our favored distraction. It's all Jane Mcgonigal's fault. \n",
      "HA! Jane... Nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a video game fan? \n",
      "Yeah, used to be very much into Nintendo back in the day.  They are still one of the world's largest video game companies.\n",
      "They're facing a lot of competition these days. What games did you play? \n",
      "I liked the old school games, Transylvania, Pro Wrestling, Zelda, and the first Mario which is one of the top selling video game franchises.  You?\n",
      "I used to play computer games, not video games. I liked stuff on the PC. I have played F-zero on the Super Nintendo, plus some football games on the Sega.\n",
      "I liked alot of the old school football games, like Madden.  Played that a ton in college.  F-zer was pretty cool too, the first racing game to run at 60 fps.\n",
      "Played a lot of Madden on the Genesis. I learned a lot about football. Never really liked other football games. Did you play Gameboy?\n",
      "No, never really got into that.  I think that was specifically for pokemon and I never played that game.\n",
      "I played GB back in the 90s. I wasn't the best platform, but many people had the games.\n",
      "Yeah.  Nintendo has been around a long time, over a hundred years.  They have really reinvented themselves over the years.\n",
      "They've designed some great games. They'll always be a force in the industry. \n",
      "Agreed.  And they're even branched off into sports ownership.  They own the seatle mariners.\n",
      "Nintendo of America is in Seattle, so I'm not surprised. \n",
      "Large Japanese influence in Seattle.  Fusajiro Yamaucho founded Nntendo by the way.\n",
      "I know the company used to make some kind of playing cards. Not much of a market for that these days.\n",
      "Somewhat.  My brother in law plays the Magic game, but I don't really understand it.  Viedeo games are so much more popular, all over the world.  Funny that it is illegal for kids under 16 to play games after midnight in south korea.\n",
      "I think the kids were up all night playing instead of studying. \n",
      "Makes sense.  Not sure how to police that though.  Some say as a planet we play three billion hours of video games a week.  That is unfathomable to me.  \n",
      "People get addicted. Well, I enjoyed chatting!\n",
      "Same here, have a great day.\n",
      "Thanks!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you have a nintendo? \n",
      "Yea, have the First Mario kart that came out in 1992 too\n",
      "Nice. Did you know that coins in mario kart made you go faster? \n",
      "Yea, I remember collecting a bunch of coins and not spinning out when hit with the turtle shell too\n",
      "Did you know it is illegal for kids under 16 in South Korea to play video games past midnight? \n",
      "I mean I don't think kids should play past midnight but to make it a law is ridiculous \n",
      "Yeah, that is pretty absurd. Did you know nintendo produced a lego knock off? \n",
      "No, I did know they made playing cards though\n",
      "Oh yeah, I remember that. It was founded as a card company in 1889. \n",
      "Yea and know they own the Seattle Mariners, they've come a far way\n",
      "Do they really? I didn't know that. Is that true?\n",
      "Yea and you can use a 3ds to order food direct to your seat during a Mariners game\n",
      "That is pretty cool. Would you recommend a ps4 or xbox over nintendo now though? \n",
      "Only if don't either have a ps4 or Xbox already, I bought a switch just to basically play Mario and Pokemon lol\n",
      "Is that their new game console, the mini thing? \n",
      "Yea, you can play the Switch on the tv or a handheld, it came out in 2017\n",
      "Interesting, maybe I'll check it out. Does it have newer games or just old ones? \n",
      "Mostly new games like Mario Kart 8 deluxe and new versions of Mario and Zelda too\n",
      "Oooh, that does sound cool. Right now I just play games on the PC. Well, nice chatting. \n",
      "You too, I'm gonna play some F-zero x at 64fps\n",
      "Nice! Take it easy!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello. Did you know Nintendo is over 100 years old?\n",
      "No I didn't know that. I do know that the N64 was awesome though! I Loved f-zero that game was so fast it's a racing game\n",
      "That was a good game. They started out as a playing card company. I didn't know they owned the Mariners.\n",
      "No I didn't know that either. I also didn't know that they made a handheld system just for the game Pokemon back in 2001, I wonder what system that was\n",
      "I never heard of that either. I wonder if it was only for the Japanese market? At the Mariners games, you can install an app for the 3DS to order food.\n",
      "That's really good at makes me hungry! and yes like you said, Nintendo is over 100 years old but they started making playing cards originally, they did not start with making video games\n",
      "I think its awesome that Xbox has controllers for quadriplegics, they can use them on other consoles too.\n",
      "Yes I think that's really nice. I remember when Xbox first came out back in 2001, I got it on launch day, my parents got it for me while I was at school LOL\n",
      "My son would be the one who spent $2600 to win an xbox at a carnival game...and end up with the banana with dreadlocks.\n",
      "LOL yep unfortunately should have just bought the Xbox out right haha. Do you know that the Army uses Xbox 360 controllers? It's cheaper than making custom ones apparently\n",
      "Yes,  I did. A friend's son us a UAV pilot. Tom Hank's brother voices Woody in games and merchandise.\n",
      "Yeah that's interesting. They probably sound very similar since their brothers haha. I remember that if you left the Xbox on for a long time you would hear weird sounds if you had the dashboard on the screen, and apparently that is a thing they intended LOL that's crazy\n",
      "That is weird. Almost as weird as games being called cathode ray tube amusement devices, by the military.\n",
      "Yes that name definitely sucks the fun right out of video games LOL. Do you know that humans as a whole play about 3 billion hours of video games a week?\n",
      "I can believe it, and I wonder how many of those South korean kids under 16 abide by the 'no games after midnight\" rule?\n",
      "Yeah that would have been a problem for me as a kid haha. Do you know who Stephen Fry is? He did the narration for a lot of movies and video games like the Harry Potter video games\n",
      "Yeah. He also did the narration for Little Big Planet.\n",
      "Oh wow I did like that game. I never played The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy game, although I did watch the movie, did you read the book or watch the movie?\n",
      "I have not. It's on my list. Did you ever have any of the lego knock-offs that Nintendo produced?\n",
      "No I don't. But that does sound interesting. I wonder if they're worth any money? I do collect Lego I have a lot of those LOL I would be mad if I had some counterfeit Lego in my collection though\n",
      "I like their architecture series. I guess some classify video games as an art form.\n",
      "Yes I think so. I miss the days of the Xbox though. They first came out with online video games then, and I would spend a lot of time on Xbox Live\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi how are you? have you seen guardians of the galaxy?\n",
      "Hello, yes I have seen it ,  love that movie!\n",
      "i have not seen it yet. i hear that it is pretty funny. i dont usually watch superhero films because it is just a lot of explosions. i like dialog.\n",
      "Ah they have some pretty funny content.  I think its on Netflix right now.  Vhina/ taiwan renamed the movie to \"interplanetary unusual attack team\"\n",
      "What the heck kind of name is that? sounds a bit stilted.\n",
      "It doesnt roll off the tongue at all lol its ridiculous,  you cant even say it fast. \n",
      "Yeah. Chris Pratt is in GotG, right? he is a funny guy.\n",
      "Yeah he is one of the main characters,  hes is very funny in both of the movies. \n",
      "He used to work at a restaurant in hawaii, i think. i saw pictures of him.\n",
      "Oh really,  wow that must have been awhile ago. James gnn wanted chris pratt for the part he was willing to cgi a six pack on the actor lol\n",
      "I think that is funny. chris pratt was also in a jurassic park movie. i would not have expected him to get that part.\n",
      "yeah i liked him in Jurassic park too! He stole his outfit from guardians of the galaxy to visit sick children.  Guess he is following johnny depps move \n",
      "Yeah, Johnny likes to go to hospitals in the Jack Sparrow outfit. great guy. the kids must love him. \n",
      "Yeah that is awesome\n",
      "Do you follow disney at all? i did when i was a kid.\n",
      "Yes,  I actually love Disney,  My kids cant get enough of it,  I get sucked in too.  \n",
      "I havent seen a disney film in a while. do you have a recommendation?\n",
      "Wreck it Ralph is really good.  Incredibles,  Moana,  Coco,  Frozen.  The pixar / Disney movies are really good,  but they usually dont have many or any songs. \n",
      "I like the songs! they are fun, and usually well written. Anyway, great chat!\n",
      "Been great chatting. \n",
      "Have a great evening! Take care!\n",
      "Thanks you too!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hey there, do you know disney company?\n",
      "Yes, somewhat.  I know they fired James Gunn of Guardian of the Galaxy fame. \n",
      "Do you know what the real name of minnie mouse is?\n",
      "I think it's Minerva Mouse whatever that means... Did you know Bill Nye consulted with Disney of Flubber?\n",
      "That guy was everywhere. Did you ever watch wall-e?\n",
      "I tried to.  I'm not much for animation.  I think the new Mary Poppins is animated.\n",
      "I am not sure about it, it might be. You mentioned James Gunn earlier. Apparently he wanted Chris Pratt so much in the movie that he was willing to cgi a six pack on the actor.\n",
      "Hee.  He could just exercise.  I'm not sure if Gunn was fired appropriately.  Something about \"offensive tweets.\"  I'm sick of this PC court of public opinion stuff.\n",
      "I know a little too much sometimes. In china the movie was renamed inerplanetary unusual attack team.\n",
      "I guess that goes over better in China.  Seem like a lot of editing for nothing. They are up to Vol. 3...\n",
      "Yeah I know so much they have been doing with it. there was a mary poppins line in there that was ad libbed.\n",
      "With Julie Andrews (just joking)? I wonder if they needed a 55,000 core computer like for Big Hero 6?\n",
      "Maybe. Do you like Chris Pratt as an actor?\n",
      "Sorta... I do like Glenn Howerton (Dennis on Always Sunny in Philadelphia). They almost cast him as lead in Guardians of the Galaxy. \n",
      "Apparently he was nineteen and waiting tables when he was discovered.\n",
      "In the right place at the right time.  I never watched Parks & Recreation so I really don't know much about Pratt...\n",
      "Oh I loved that show. He was so good in it. He stole the costume from the guardians of galaxy movie to go visits kids in the hospital.\n",
      "That's cool of him.  I'll pay more attention.  Wow, Disney is so huge.  I didn't know they owned ESPN. \n",
      "They do? I didn't know that either. Apparently when James Gunn was fired, the cast signed letters asking disney to rehire him.\n",
      "From the what the first GotG grossed, maybe they should.  He was fired over things he said a decade ago.  That's crazy. \n",
      "I know. It was really nice chatting with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you heard of this game? Astro Bot Rescue Mission' rekindles the fun gaming for even the most jaded\n",
      "No i have not! I don't have a playstation\n",
      "Apparently it's quite popular. I dont have a playstation either!\n",
      "Not sure about it... very scared that robots are going to take over the world!\n",
      "Aww. I think we are headed a way that they will be taking alot of jobs. But atleast we are talking about a universal income.\n",
      "LOL... yeah? maybe they can debone my chicken?\n",
      "Maybe so! I'm hoping they will be able to take care of me when I am old! Michael jackson planned to build a 50 foot tall moon walking robot to roam the desert sands of las vegas.\n",
      "like the rats controlling a robot and then taking over the world using the robots?  LOL\n",
      "OMG! I just read that!\n",
      "Maybe the us government can use their 1760 playstations to take down the robot rats!\n",
      "There you go! Send that idea to them! Especially since all these consoles are made in China! Might be a secret plan!\n",
      "thats funny a soccer game spanned three playstation generations since it's really the only international sport\n",
      "wow! Nintendo produced a lego knock-off when they were a toy company.\n",
      "I did not know nintendo owned the seattle mariners?\n",
      "me either! Nintendo released a handheld console specifically for pokemon in 2001.\n",
      "I think nintendo should build the 10 foot robot in memory of michael jackson\n",
      "Crazy! I'll have to look that up!\n",
      "You ever played grand theft auto?\n",
      "no, you? Japan's third most-valuable company with a market value of over $85 billion, for Ninetendo!\n",
      "long time ago... it was aweful!\n",
      "I bet. i was never interested myself. seemed very violent.\n",
      "Yeah it was! Thats why i always stuck with nintendo games.  Much more friendly\n",
      "I didn't know this..December 3, 1994, with the launch of the original PlayStation in Japan.\n",
      "I did not know playstations early consoles supported linux base\n",
      "really? strange! The original console in the series was the first video game console to ship 100 million units.\n",
      "WOW!  Not sure how you compare a video game to an amusement park?\n",
      "Me either! Do you know how?\n",
      "I guess maybe if i played astrobot rescue then maybe i would\n",
      "I don't know about you, but no thank you! PlayStation 3, was released in 2006 and has sold over 80 million consoles worldwide as of November 2013.\n",
      "that's crazy!  Maybe robots can play video games?\n",
      "That would be awful! PlayStation Network is an online service with over 110 million users worldwide (as of July 2013).\n",
      "See that F zero game runs at 60 frames per second... thats crazy realistic!\n",
      "that is! And people like their consoles. The PlayStation 2 is the best-selling home console to date, having reached over 155 million units sold as of December 28, 2012. \n",
      "You ever played legend of zelda games?\n",
      "no, not a big gamer, you? The u.s. department of defense used 1760 playstation 3's to build a supercomputer because it was cheaper than the alternative\n",
      "i used to be but not as much anymore!  I wanna hear the GTA soundtrack!\n",
      "Is it supposed to be good?\n",
      "Don't know, but i am a fan of soundtracks\n",
      "If you have the time to truly play it. \"Stay\" is a brilliant visual novel that taunts you for neglecting it.\n",
      "i saw that and want to check it out along with destiny 2\n",
      "'Destiny 2: Forsaken' is addictive and fun to play. \n",
      "maybe the rats controlling the robots can play destiny 2\n",
      "That should be fun to see! Robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within.\n",
      "grant imahara created a robot\n",
      "Why? Robots may be constructed to take on human form but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to how they look.\n",
      "for craig feguson to have a sidekick\n",
      "Fun! We should be just about done with this hit!\n",
      "yeah, this was a fun one!\n",

      "hey do you like Nintendo games?\n",
      "I do like nintendo games! Do you?\n",
      "I do have a Nintendo Switch! did you know they were founded in 1889?\n",
      "I had no idea. What were they founded as because they didn't have video games back then?\n",
      "haha could be, they also didn't have electricity! ya they started as a playing card company apparently\n",
      "that's a weird origin story. I used to love playing contra. \n",
      "ya contra is great, I also like mario bros and mega man haha, did you ever play the N64?\n",
      "I didn't play that one but I remember playing mega man. I loved that game too. And metal gear!\n",
      "ya on the N64 they had a game called Fzero X, it's a racing game and was the first racing game to run at 60fps\n",
      "Was it any good? I also had a playstation.\n",
      "ya it was pretty good, it was fast but the graphics were very simple which is how it got to run at 60 fps\n",
      "What games do you play on the switch?\n",
      "I played zelda, mario, and we play Mario Party a lot that is probably my favorite game, we have friends over and play 4 player mario party its awesome, what about you\n",
      "I dont really play anymore. My last game I played was modern warfare (call of duty). I was never a huge gamer. Didn't even have it at college.\n",
      "ah, ya so you played call of duty, did you ever play with legos as a kid?\n",
      "I did. Now I step on them as a parent. Did you play with them?\n",
      "I definitely did haha, apparently Nintendo made knock off legos early in their history when they started to make toys, but I like real legos personally\n",
      "Me too. However, since becoming a parent, I really hate them. I find them everywhere. And I step on them and it hurts!\n",
      "haha oh ya I have stepped on lego it does hurt, speaking of videogames the us government bought almost 2000 ps3's to build a supercomputer apparently\n",
      "I heard Nintendo owns the seatle mariners. Who knew>\n",
      "oh wow I didn't know that, they are definitely very successful, they even released a handheld specifically for a pokemon game if that tells you anything\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi!  Are you a fan of Nintendo?\n",
      "Yes I am. Are you?\n",
      "I am!  Super Mario was always my favroite game.  Did you know Nintendo started in 1889 as a playing card company?\n",
      "I always loved Super Mario when I was growing up. I did not know that fact. That's interesting!\n",
      "They also own the Seatle Mariners.  \n",
      "I was not aware of that either. It's interesting that the phrase 'it's on like donkey kong' was trademarked by Nintendo. \n",
      "Did they trademark that?  Smart, it is still a popular phrase.  I have friends who say that all the time.\n",
      "Yes, it was trademarked in 2010. I've heard that phrased used a lot as well. \n",
      "Nintendo even made a lego knock off.  They have done so many things I havent even realized.\n",
      "Cool. They definitely have done so many things that I hadn't realized either. I didn't realize they had tried several small niche businesses as well.\n",
      "It is only the third most profitable company in Japan too.  I wonder what the first two are.\n",
      "Wow! I'd like to know as well considering Nintendo has such a large cash reserve that it could lose so much money and not bankrupt for a long while. \n",
      "Yeah, they are valued at over $85 Billion.\n",
      "That is insane! I didn't realize they produced Pokemon as well. I never got into that. \n",
      "i got into the PokemonGo, but not anything else.\n",
      "I saw people using that all over the place. I never got into it, but I think I would have been rather addicted if I had. \n",
      "It is a fun thing to do, some of my friends got me into it.\n",
      "It seems like it would really keep you active.\n",
      "It does a bit, encourages walking.  I enjoy the time outside with it.\n",
      "That's a really positive thing for sure, as most video games encourage being sedentary and staying indoors. \n",
      "True!  Its been nice chatting!  Have a good night!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good morning!  Are you a fan of Disney?\n",
      "I love the franchise, its been almost 100 years of magic since the company got founded back in 1923\n",
      "Walt and Roy Disney definitely knew what they were doing back in the day.\n",
      "I bet they did, they changed our culture forever with the creation of Mickey Mouse and his friends. \n",
      "It's funny when you think about it, isn't it?  I mean, a mouse had such a profound effect on everyone and everything.\n",
      "It has, and then theres also the princess and all the other character Disney has created.\n",
      "For example, Minnie Mouse.  Do you know what Minnie is short for?\n",
      "No what is Minnie a short for?\n",
      "Minerva.  Her name is actually Minerva Mouse.  I think Minnie suits her much better don't you?\n",
      "I prefer Minnie Mouse a lot more.\n",
      "Have you ever seen Big hero 6?\n",
      "I have that movie was great cool fact but it was done using a 55,000 core super computer\n",
      "I thought it was great too! It really surprised me that it was so good!  It's also impressive about that super computer don't you think?\n",
      "It is impressive, that must be a really powerful machine, do you know who Bill Nye is?\n",
      "I do. He's the science guy.  He's also a founder of the planetary society I think.\n",
      "Yeah the same one, well he also appears in Flubber, he is the science consultant in that movie\n",
      "That i didn't know!  I guess by having him consult they added some authenticity to the movie and to flubber itself.\n",
      "It did, many people liked his show so yeah, do you like Chris Pratt?\n",
      "He's okay. I've seen him in a couple of movies like guardians of the galaxy and a jurassic park one.  Do you?\n",
      "I think his a great actor, I thought he was younger but he was born in the year 1979\n",
      "I thought he was younger too.  I learned recently that he got discovered while waiting tables in Maui.  That's cool.  Well, I've got to go now.  It's been nice chatting with you!  Have a great day!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "have you seen guardians of the galaxy?\n",
      "I have seen it.  I thought it was good. Have you seen it?\n",
      "i have not. do you know why james gunn wasn't rehired?\n",
      "I think the studio didn't want any bad publicity or law suits from his tweets that he made years ago.\n",
      "what were his inappropriate jokes about?\n",
      "Seems like they were were sexist and homophobic in nature.  In today's climate it would be easy for someone to claim offense to them.\n",
      "yes you're spot on. do you think his firing was fair since he had apologized before?\n",
      "I don't think it's fair. I don't think people should be held accountable for things they said years ago.  Life was different years ago and people not so easily offended.  You?\n",
      "i agree with you. it happened several years ago. it says pro-trumpers found them and posted them to social media. that seems odd...\n",
      "It does seem odd and makes you wonder if that part is true.  Who knows.  I think if he did a good job on his movies and didn't commit an actual crime then so be it.\n",
      "yes. so i believe guardians is a marvel movie. do you like other marvel movies?\n",
      "I do like Iron Man and Thor and Captain America.  How about you?\n",
      "i don't believe i've seen those. i don't follow the marvel series too closely. i do know chris pratt plays a role in a show on tv, parks and rec. have you seen it?\n",
      "No and I didn't know he did that.  I did see him in Jurassic Park and thought he was good.\n",
      "i saw the lastest one, jurassic park 3. did you see that? it was pretty good!\n",
      "Not sure. The last one that I saw was a year ago I think.\n",
      "yes this one just game out in the last 6 months. i think there are a couple guardians movies, have you seen them all or just one?\n",
      "Just the first one.  Have you seen them all?\n",
      "no i havent seen any. well, i've seen parts of a few but haven't watched one through. i think there is a raccoon or something in them? lol\n",
      "Yeah, the first one was cute and fun I guess.  Did you know about the subculture dedicated to finding the hidden mickey mouse images in all disney things?  I wonder if there is one in the movie.\n",
      "haha i didnt know that, but i imagine at the park they put them all sorts of different places!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey what do you think about Chris Pratt by the way? It's funny that he wanted to rehire the director James Gunn for the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie\n",
      "I like Chris Pratt but obviously James Gunn liked him more as he was willing to CGI a six pack on him for Guardians of the Galaxy. Ha! What are your thoughts on Pratt?\n",
      "Yeah I like Chris Pratt a lot. I think he should be in almost every movie LOL. It's funny that he used to be a waiter at Bubba Gump Shrimp\n",
      "Yeah, he was working there when he was scouted by a director. He's a real success story considering he went from living in his van and waiting tables to becoming a Hollywood star!\n",
      "Oh yeah absolutely! It's cool that he told Steven Spielberg he would be in Jurassic Park 4, back in 2010, and then he essentially was lol\n",
      "So true. I also think it's cool he stole his Starlord costumes from the Guardians of the Galaxy set so he could wear it to visit sick hospital kids assuming the film was a hit.\n",
      "It is really nice of him. What do you think about Glenn Howerton? He actually was the star of Always Sunny in Philadelphia and he almost got the lead in Jurassic World\n",
      "It's weird how he lost both of those roles to Chris Pratt, Isn't it? Did you know that Mary Poppins line in Guardians 2 was actually ad libbed?\n",
      "No I didn't know that. That is interesting. Chris Pratt has been in a lot of other good movies like Moneyball and also Her\n",
      "Yep! As well as Infinity War and its upcoming sequel. Also the leading man in the Lego Movie! Let's not forget about Parks and Recreation as well which he received award nominations for!\n",
      "ya youre right Parks and Recreation is awesome! do you like Disney movies by the way? I always liked the Disney movie Wall-E\n",
      "Oh, yes! I love Disney movies, especially Wall-E.  In fact, Wall-E was named by Pixar as a tip of the hat to Walter Elias Disney himself!\n",
      "That's really cool! Did you like the movie Big Hero 6? That used to super computer in order to render all of the images in it\n",
      "That's interesting! Are you a fan of Bill Nye? He actually served as a science consultant for Disney on Flubber, surprisingly enough!\n",
      "That is surprising especially considering how unrealistic that movie is LOL, also did you know that Minnie Mouse's real name is Minerva Mouse\n",
      "That's pretty cool. Never knew she had a real name! Just as many people don't know there's a subculture dedicated to finding hidden Mickey Mouse images in all things Disney!\n",
      "Yep that is cool LOL. What do you think about Vin Diesel getting a secret script that says what Groot is actually speaking in the movies\n",
      "Is that so? Speaking of Groot, I can't believe his first appearance was way back in 1959 in what was called \"Tales to Astonish #13\".\n",
      "That is a long time ago! What do you think about the Chinese name for Guardians of the Galaxy over there? It is the: interplanetary unusual attack team LOL\n",
      "Ha! Did you read the full letter signed by the cast voicing their support for James Gunn after his firing that Pratt posted on Instagram? It was so sad and I hate he was fired but you've gotta be extra careful in this day and age!\n",
      "Yes you do have to be extra careful! I was shocked all those people signed the letter for him though, he did after all apologize for the homophobic posts\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How's it going, do you like Disney? It's the worlds largest independent media conglomerate\n",
      "I do like Disney.  I have an 8 year old so definitely been rewatching all the Disney stuff from my childhood!  I can't believe the Disney company is almost 100 years old\n",
      "Yea, Disney has come a long way since the Disney brothers founded it in 1923\n",
      "Who would have thought a company that established themselves as an animation leader would grow into such a conglomerate!?\n",
      "Yea, Disney grew from an animation studio into one that did live-action film, tv, and theme parks!\n",
      "I loved the movie Wall-E.  I did not realize until recently it was named that as a tribute to Walter Elias Disney.  Very cool!\n",
      "I had no clue, I also didn't know minnie was short for Minerva mouse\n",
      "Such a fancy name!  Did you read Dr. Suess growing up?  I was a big fan!  He really accomplished a lot.  Over 60 books, 11 tv specials, 5 films, a Broadway musical, and 4 television series!\n",
      "Yea, Dr Seuss accomplished so much despite being voted least likely to succeed by his classmates\n",
      "If only they knew!  He was actually a doctor too!\n",
      "That's pretty cool, I just thought it was a pen name he used so he could still write for his college's humor magazine after being caught drinking\n",
      "No, although it was just an honorary Phd from Dartmouth.  However, he only used the Dr. part of his name after receiving this.\n",
      "That's pretty cool, he deserved it for coming up with the word \"nerd\"\n",
      "Haha, yup I wonder what his movies would have got on Rotten Tomatoes.  Do you use that site?  I use it a lot, but it can be so far off.  Spy Kids somehow is 93% on Rotten Tomatoes!\n",
      "I tend to avoid Rotten Tomatoes since it's owned by Warner Bros, too much conflict of interest\n",
      "Yup.  They must give out a lot of 100% ratings since Netflix alone has 150 movies with a 100% rating from Rotten Tomatoes.\n",
      "Too bad video game movies can't do better than 44% on Rotten Tomatoes \n",
      "That is crazy.  You would think a company launched by 3 undergrads would give more love to video games!\n",
      "And Michael Bay too, but his average film rating is 38%\n",
      "His movies are just OK, but 38% average is for sure surprising.  \n",
      "Well I got to go, nice talking with you\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey do you like Disney movies? I guess the name Minnie Mouse is actually short for Minerva\n",
      "Her mother must not have liked her!  Yes, I am a Disney fan. Amazing how big  it has grown in less than 100 years!\n",
      "yeah! it was founded back in 1923 and it is definitely approaching 100 years. That seems really insane to me\n",
      "It definitely has established itself as a leader in the animation industry. Everyone knows who they are and has seen a Disney movie!\n",
      "Yes I agree! What is your favorite Disney movie by the way? I really like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast\n",
      "Those are probably my favorites too! I have not watched much of the Disney Channel, so I cannot weigh in on that, but the movies are usually a good bet when selecting something to watch. Imagine that all pf this would not have happened if it were not for the firing of Walt Disney from the local newspaper for not being creative enough... He showed them!\n",
      "Yes he did! Have you ever seen the movie Big Hero 6? I didn't really like it but I guess it used a 50,000 core supercomputer to render\n",
      "I have not seen it. Must be pretty awesome...I wonder if it will be shown on their channel? After all, the DIsney CHannel only shows Disney content. They don't even allow adds for non-Disney shows or products!\n",
      "Oh I never knew that. have you seen the Disney movie Flubber? Bill Nye was a science consultant for that movie. That movie is definitely not realistic though haha\n",
      "Disney, not realistic? Never!  Did yo ever see the collaborative film by Disney and Salvator Dali called, \"Destino? I don't think Dali was known for his realism...\n",
      "No he wasn't. I like Salvador Dali a lot though he was born on my birthday haha. Have you ever seen a\"Hidden Mickey\"in any of the movies, I guess there's a subculture that looks for those in the movies\n",
      "Yeah, and there was a big stink years ago when somebody saw the word \"sex\" painted amonst the stars in the Lion King cartoon.  REgardless, it has not slowed down the money-making machie. Disney makes about $1,110 per second.\n",
      "Haha I've seen that actually. I think that was in The Lion King right? Have you seen the movie Wall-E? I guess it was a tip to Walter Elias Disney\n",
      "Nice flick! We really should gid a nod to another children's icon, Dr Seuss! Are you a fan? \n",
      "I guess he's ok but he's not my favorite. But I am also an adult haha. I guess that during World War II he took a break from kids books and did some political stuff, I never knew that\n",
      "Really? In today's climate, he could be elected President, or at least the Cat in the Hat might...Every bit a colorful character as any other candidate on the horizon...\n",
      "Well that would be shocking because in high school he was voted least likely to succeed apparently haha.\n",
      "Was theis the same fortune telling prowess as for DIsney? I bet nobody forsaw when he was studying at Dartmouth that he would amount to his current level of notoriety...\n",
      "No not at all. No one would have foresaw that he got an honorary PhD from there either. And that's only when he started to use the doctor part of his name\n",
      "I like how he pronounced his own name, to rhyme with the word, \"voice\"\n",
      "That's interesting I never knew that. Apparently he was also afraid of children. He felt they were very unpredictable\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You !\n",
      "Hello hows it going?  same here!  Do you like Disney? \n",
      "nope :) not anymore - since they destroyed Star Wars...\n",
      "lol that's funny.  The theme park is also coming out with a Star Wars land. \n",
      "I'm really disappointing that huge studio like that don't understand what true devoted fans want to see in a SW movie...\n",
      "That is sad.  How would you prefer to see it?  \n",
      "I wouldn't want to see legendary Luke Skywalker like they portrayed it... \n",
      "Since,  you don't like disney,  Heres a fun fact,  Rotten tomatoes is owned by wb!\n",
      "wb ? Warner Brothers ? really ? was it always like that or maybe they bought it out ?\n",
      "Yes Warner Bros.  I don't actually know.  Do you think it being owned by WB has any effect on the reviews?\n",
      "I think it does... I'm sure there is a pressure from WB about certain titles...\n",
      "Maybe.  Also,  its nice that Netflix has 150 movies that have perfect rating on rotten tomatoes\n",
      "That's quite an achievement ! I remember 2-3 years ago there was like one movie on Netflix and look what is happening now... we don't have enough time to catch up with all the shows and movies... great job NF ! :)\n",
      "Right! They have some pretty amazing movie selection.  \n",
      "Yup ! and not like crappy movies, but actually good ones that I watched with pleasure with famous actors. This is the future of television ;)\n",
      "Did you know they named it rotten tomatoes from when people use to throw tomatoes on stage. \n",
      "No, I didn't know that. Really good name than  - I like it :) I just hope they are going to stay as independent as possible... \n",
      "I guess that depends on Warner Bros!\n",
      "dammit :) I don't trust them.... maybe we should start a company like that ? I feel like we would be good at it :) lol\n",
      "Yes!  i would love to get paid to watch movies and give reviews!  Lets do it!  \n",
      "I was born to a job like that... :)\n",
      "lol same!  Good chatting! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Seuss books were one of my favorites as a kid. I remember we even had them at school!\n",
      "Oh, yeah! I enjoyed them as the classic books and films, and also as the Disney updated versions!\n",
      "I actually did not realize until recently that Disney was behind some Dr. Seuss stuff. I did know that he was voted least likely in his class to succeed, though.\n",
      "Yeah. I was surprised when I learned that Dr Suesse was afraid of children and their unpredictability. Like, the universe of Suesse is soo predictable?\n",
      "The Grinch was a good movie but I only saw the first one. The Lorax looks like a good Seuss movie I haven't seen yet, either.\n",
      "I heard Disney slips images of Mickey Mouse into their produced works. I wonder if they are in any of the Disney Suesse remakes?\n",
      "I've heard lots of claims that the Walt Disney Company has tons of hidden images in their stuff...but honestly I bet it's only coincidence or the animators just having some fun.\n",
      "Did you know the name Minnie (in the Disney character) is short for Minerva?\n",
      "Minerva...I want to say there is a cartoon with a lynx named that. I wish Disney would depict females as better than falling in love with the best looking Prince around!\n",
      "Snow White seemed to have a thing for Dopey. Does that count for something? I saw Dopey at one of the Disney theme parks, and he was looking mighty fine...\n",
      "Yes I have seen pictures of him there and they guy that wears his costume has huge muscles. Also I've seen cartoons fans drew of Disney Dopey with both a ripped bod and with weed references. lol\n",
      "Far out. I wonder if Bill Nye, the science guy, who wa the science consultant for Disney on the movie, Flubber...I wonder if he is ripped under his lab coat?  He could synthesize his own steroids.\n",
      "I loved that show as a kid! Wish Disney would do something new around Bill Nye the Science Guy!\n",
      "He made me proud to be a nerd! Did you know that the term \"nerd\" was first used in the Suess book \"If I Ran the Zoo\"?? \n",
      "Wow! I had no idea Seuss was the first to use nerd. That's really nifty. I still want to know why his eggs were green, though...\n",
      "Yeah, for sure!  Maybe Dr Suess was a made scientist making genetically engineered poultry on his days off. You know, Seuss was not a doctor until Dartmouth en stowed on him an honorary doctorate? Good old Theodor Geissel done good.\n",
      "No wonder he got jobs at a good handful of great companies. Most people don't even get to work at one like that in their lifetime!\n",
      "You bet.  If I remember correctly, I think Dr Seuss stories usually fair pretty well on Rotten Tomatoes, right?\n",
      "Rotten Tomatoes is a place I haven't been to in quite some time. I may have to visit again soon as I remember it being pretty entertaining!\n",
      "If you are a fan of Michael Bay films, be prepared for an average film score of only 38% They don't like Mike.\n",
      "Gosh, I didn't know they were so opinionated like that over at Rotten Tomatoes. I wonder how they lean towards Disney?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "Good, and you? I haven't seen any superhero movies in a long time, but I think I saw a brief portion of Iron Man once on a TV that was going at my job.\n",
      "Really! I feel like all the movies coming out now, like 25% are super hero movies. Do you not enjoy them?\n",
      "I probably would, I just never think to watch them. I watched the first two or three installments of the Frank Miller Batman franchise.\n",
      "Nice. So if not superhero movies, what movies do you enjoy?\n",
      "Mostly sci fi and horror. How about you?\n",
      "I enjoy sci fi and comedies. I usually like to stay home and watch the movies so I can have a cocktail or two. Do you go to the theaters and watch?\n",
      "No, I usually rent/buy DVDs or stream. I live about 20 miles from the nearest town big enough to have a theater.\n",
      "I usually use Netflix unless it is something I really want to watch. Then I will stream it. So what's your favorite horror movie>\n",
      "It's been so long since I saw one I have trouble thinking of one to be honest. I watched Stephen King's Cell recently, and I guess Alien counts as horror.\n",
      "Ok. It sounds like you may not be a movie fan. What do you prefer to do in your spare time?\n",
      "I live on a rural tract that's about half wooded ravine, so I spend a lot of time building raised garden beds and doing edible landscaping. Also I\"m a freelance writer and most of my research is enjoyable enough to double as a hobby. How about you?\n",
      "That sounds really cool. I am a father of 2, 5 & 7 year olds, and I have a full time job, do this, and teach at a university so I do not do much for fun. I do go to the gym at 4:30 am so that is my free time.\n",
      "That sounds like an incredible workload -- especially three kids 7 or below, LOL. What do you teach?\n",
      "I teach technology in sport. It is fun and the kids are great.\n",
      "That's an interesting combination of subjects! \n",
      "Yeah. It is tough because technology is ever evolving in sport and so the research is not there. I have to read a lot!\n",
      "I love opportunities to put things together in ways that haven't been examined much previously, or from new angles.\n",
      "You would love this job! So what do you grow in your gardens?\n",
      "A lot of fruit trees and berry bushes, plus high-value veggies like tomatoes and salad greens. I'll probably grow a larger amount of staple foods like legumes, corn etc. this year.\n",
      "That sounds really great. Nice chatting with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you like the marvel movies that are came out in the last 10 years?\n",
      "Yes I do. They were a lot of fun to watch. How about you, do you like Marvel movies?\n",
      "I love them, the early ones were a little rough like Thor, but Iron Man really got me hooked, i remember the first time i watched it in theatres!\n",
      "Iron Man was a very fun movie. I agree. Do you happen to know when did the Avengers: Infinity War got released?\n",
      "I think it was early 2018. I know the new one comes out next month. I loved Infinity War but it was crazy at the end, I think End Game will make it make sense.\n",
      "I agree. Thanks. Do you know who produced the Avengers: Infinity War movie?\n",
      "Wasn't it made by the Russo brothers if I remember right/\n",
      "No. It was directed by the Russo Brothers and it was produced by Marvel Studios.\n",
      "Gotcha, that makes more sense lol. Did you know the actor who played jarvis never actually saw the films\n",
      "Will that be the Iron Man films? I heard about this and I find it odd to be honest.\n",
      "Me too, he is in like 10 of these films starting with Iron Man. He plays Vision also, it is Paul Bettany. If I was him I would watch myself in every film I was ever in lol\n",
      "Me too. That would make perfect sense. I read somewhere recently that the Avengers: Infinity War was the first film ever to be shot in its entirety with digital IMAX cameras.\n",
      "wow, that is awesome. I wish I saw it in an IMAX theatre, I bet the effects would have been so much better\n",
      "I haven't watched it in an IMAX theater and now that I'm thinking about it I wish I did. You're right!!!\n",
      "for sure, maybe End Game I will do it and see the difference! Did you like the original Thor movie?\n",
      "I didn't watch Thor before. Do you happen to know when it came out?\n",
      "I am not sure, what happened?\n",
      "I was just asking you if you knew in what year the Thor movie came out.\n",
      "lol, I see it now. It came out i believe in 2011, 3 years after iron man! It was nice chatting with you!\n",
      "Do you know who directed Thor?\n",
      "Kenneth Branagh if I remember right, it was one of his better films he directed. \n",
      "Thanks. It was nice chatting with you as well!!!\n",
      "Enjoy your night, maybe watch another great marvel classic! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello,  have you watched avengers infinity war. \n",
      "Yea, it's pretty crazy some theaters  showed all 18 marvel films \n",
      "Wow,  Yeah Im in the middle of binge watching all the movies,  Im up to soiderman homecoming lol so almost done. \n",
      "I've seen most of them, even \"The Incredible Hulk\"\n",
      "Yeah that one wasnt the greatest,  but it wasnt bad for its time.  I wonder why no one liked it.  \n",
      "I really enjoyed Thor, Kenneth Brangh did a great job with the story\n",
      "Yeah I think Thor Ragnarok is my favorite out of the series.  I really like the Ant Man movies too though. \n",
      "I think my favorite is James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy, such a surprise how good it was\n",
      "Those were really good ones too!  I love that awkward guy,  Drax!  \n",
      "Yea, Age of Ultron was kinda a let down when it came out in 2015\n",
      "I like it because it advanced the storyline,  but yeah I didnt think it was the best.  Especially with all the iron mans at the end,  like ok we get it your bored and rich and smart yay.  lol \n",
      "I thought Civil war was much better and enjoyed Ant-Man and Spider-mans parts in it\n",
      "Civil war was good,  but had a sour ending.  I wasnt expecting that.  I think the acting in that one was really good,  it involved a lot of emotional stuff. \n",
      "Yea but it did the best job of setting up Infinity War. Did you know Infinity war was the first film to be shot entirely with digital Imax cameras?\n",
      "Wow that must be expensive lol Did you know the movie caused an increase in shawarma sales?\n",
      "Lol, I'm not surprised shawarma sales increased, Tony Stark did a good job making it sound good\n",
      "lol he did,  and made people who didnt know what it was curious. Did you know Tom Hiddleston was auditioning for Thor,  they decided he would be a better Loki,  I agree.  \n",
      "I heard so, I'm glad Hiddleston ended being casted as Loki instead of Thor\n",
      "Hes a perfect fit for Loki.  hes a good actor too.  They make a great team,  as actors.  You really believe they are brothers lol\n",
      "Yea marvel is really good at casting characters, like casting Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man\n",
      "Yeah another perfect fit.  Also,  ryan reynolds as deadpool.  lol\n",
      "Yep. Well I got to go, nice chatting with you\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "hey do you like Robert DOwney Jr?\n",
      "I do like him. Do you?\n",
      "ya I liked him a lot in Iron Man 1, I guess he would hide food on the set of Infinity war which is definitely weird haha\n",
      "Well, what kind of food? If it was tasty food that others would steal from him, yeah! Hide that food!\n",
      "haha it woudl be all kinds but when he eats blueberries and shawarma in that movie that was food that he hid apparently ahah\n",
      "What the heck is shawarma?\n",
      "haha its a middle eastern wrap, I think it has like lamb and a white sauce, I've had it its actually pretty good\n",
      "Well now I am hungry. That sounds pretty good. I had no idea it caused an increase in sales...\n",
      "ya that is wild isn't it, you'll have to give it a try! I wonder if blueberry sales also increased\n",
      "Ya know what's weird. I hate blueberries but love blueberry muffins. Not sure what is going on there...\n",
      "haha that is weird, do you like blueberry jam? or is the only thing with blueberries you like the muffins? haha\n",
      "I think it's just muffins. Hate blueberry jam. It doesn't taste like blueberries... And I like blueberry pancakes so maybe I just like pastry type food...\n",
      "haha I think the taste of the pastry must be covering up the blueberry taste for you then haha, never heard of your type of blueberry affliction before haha\n",
      "Maybe I will drink blueberry vodka and see if I like that. What mixes well with blueberry?\n",
      "hmmmm you could put sprite or 7 up that might be tasty, fruity vodkas go well with those typically I think\n",
      "Done! My only fear is that I will buy the vodka and then hate it. What the hell do I do with all that terrible vodka?\n",
      "haha well if I were close I'd buy it from you if you didn't like it lol, Hmmm maybe give it to a friend, that is a good quesiton, maybe only buy a little bit to try it first\n",
      "Who am I kidding, I will drink the whole thing. When I ran out of coke for my captains, I used gatorade. It was gross, got the job done, and I was well hydrated! \n",
      "lol, ya don't let good drinks go to waste! do you like the thor films at all? I hated all of them except I did like Thor Ragnarok\n",
      "I do but he is too good looking. I mean, give us average looking guys a shot! Nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi! Are you a Star Wars fan?\n",
      "I do and I really like it. Do you know who played the character of Poe Dameron?\n",
      "No.  IS that the film Star Wars: The Force Awakens?\n",
      "Yes that one. It was played by Oscar Isaac who is from Guatemala\n",
      "Nice. Did you know that George Lucus's wife was the reason behind many of the changes in the original Star Wars? Ideas  like Obi Wsn's death, among others...\n",
      "Yeah and that is why she won an Academy Award for editing the film\n",
      "Nice! It is amazing to me that James Earl Jones, the voice of hte original Darth Vader, took only 2.5 hours to record all of his lines for the first movie. And he was paid only $7.5k\n",
      "That is insane. Did you know it is dubbed in Navajo as well?\n",
      "Wow! That's like a first, right?\n",
      "Yes the first major movie for sure\n",
      "So much trivia gold around the Star Wars saga!  Did you know that the cast of the Empire Strikes Back were given fake scripts at first to keep secret that nature of the relationship between Luke and Darth?\n",
      "Wow, an 20th century fox was convinced that the whole movie was going to flop\n",
      "Fear of loss must have blinded them to the potential.  I guess that is how George Lucas retained  rights?\n",
      "Yeah so it cost fox billions and Lucas got all that money\n",
      "Whose idea was it to change the role of Luke Skywalker from the originally written female role to a male?\n",
      "I actually do not know that. DO you know?\n",
      "No. I hoped you might. Star Wars has go to be one of my favorite SciFi movies!  I wonder if George Lucas used the list of accurate space technology terms from NASA when putting this movie together?\n",
      "Being a huge fan, I am wondering if I should look into booking Luke's boyhood home for a nigh for $10 in tunisia\n",
      "It's a must see landmark!  Another must: You gotta get an MIT Science Fiction Society Membership, and pay the extra bucks to get the more xpensive membership that covers you in case you die and come back!\n",
      "Nice I like that, there are so many ways to get involved with this.\n",
      "Yeah, attend a SciFi convention if yo have time! Nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a Star Wars fan?\n",
      "Yes, star wars is great. i really like the original trilogy.\n",
      "Me too, that was the best out of all the movies, and basically the only ones I watched. It made George Lucas a billionaire \n",
      "George was smart about merchandising. he got the rights for a song. \n",
      "Right, he didn't accept the directing fee and instead got licensing and merchandising rights instead\n",
      "it was about half a million, but he had money from previous films he directed. i guess he was willing to take the chance.\n",
      "and it paid off lol. Did you hear how much Jame Earl Jones made for Vader's lines?\n",
      "I cant imagine it was much. the budget for the film was low. he had the perfect voice for it though\n",
      "for sure, I wonder if he got paid more and more after the inital success. He got like 7500 for 2.5 hours of work lol\n",
      "I wonder if he got residuals on the back end. he probably got more for the next films.\n",
      "I would hope so. Did you hear George Lucas's wife got awards for for editing of the movie\n",
      "yeah, she really contributed to the story too. lots of great ideas that made the movie memorable.\n",
      "For sure, I heard she thought of the kiss seen and obi wan's death \n",
      "yes, george has a lot of great ideas, but he needs help shaping the story. i dont like the later films because of that.\n",
      "That is a good way to put it. I liked Luke Skywalker a lot. If you ever visit tunisia you can pay 10 dollars and stay a night in the home he lived at as a boy in the movie\n",
      "that sounds like fun! i bet the true fans line up to do that. i dont know if ill ever make it to tunisia, but i will keep that in mind\n",
      "Me neither lol. Are you into science fiction movies also?\n",
      "I like science fiction films. i liked alien and aliens. you?\n",
      "I loved those movies, so scary and thrilling! I like anything Nasa also\n",
      "what NASA films? i dont know those\n",
      "I just like Nasa in general I guess. It was so nice chatting with you, enjoy your day!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you know the last jedi was the highest grossing movie of 2017?\n",
      "No I didn't know that. I know it got a lot of backlash though, what did you think about it?\n",
      "it was ok but apparently fans thought it so bad that they petitioned to remove it from the canon\n",
      "I agree with them I thought it was actually horrible LOL but I'm thinking they're not going to take it out of anon unfortunately. Even Mark Hamill who plays Luke Skywalker said that it was bad\n",
      "but he recanted! i bet he quickly found that it was the wrong thing to say\n",
      "Yep you definitely don't want to talk about multimillion-dollar movies like that that you're starring in LOL what do you think about the other star wars movies though\n",
      "maybe thats why they killed him off...or whatever it is that happened to his character\n",
      "Yep that's true. I actually like the first Star Wars movie the best. It was made back in 1977\n",
      "george lucas was a good business man he propositioned 20th century fox to not take a 500k fee and instead to keep the merchandising and licensing rights. its made him a billionaire\n",
      "Yep that was really smart! He is genius, but so was his wife at the time, Marcia Lucas, she helped with a lot of editing and different things for the story and doesn't get any credit\n",
      "she did get credit! she won an academy award while george lucas hasn't won any\n",
      "Well that's good I didn't know that. But yeah her idea to kill off Obi-Wan and also for a Leia to give Luke a good luck kiss I think we're very important to the movie\n",
      "yes because of the ew factor when we found out they were siblings lol\n",
      "Haha that's a good point! do you understand the language of Navajo by the way? Apparently you could watch Star Wars and Navajo if you can haha\n",
      "I didn't even know navajo was a language. james earl jones only spent 2.5 . hours recording darth vaders voice and was paid $7500 i guess thats good money in the 70's\n",
      "Yeah I think so.plus that's a lot of money to make per hour, even for such an iconic role, I bet he got paid more for future movies though\n",
      "i guess it depends on what kind of royalties he gets. \n",
      "Yep I forgot about royalties too. What other science fiction movies do you like though? I really like the movie Gattaca\n",
      "Im not sure Ive seen that one. I know it has ethan hawke. NASA apparently liked it since they named it the most accurate science fiction movie of all time\n",
      "Yes it's a great movie you need to watch it! It's interesting that NASA has a page of space technology terms that movie writers can use that are incredibly accurate, that's probably what Gattaca used \n",
      "luke skywalker was written as a girl! hahah\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "do you like star ward?\n",
      "I sure do. Do you know when the movie came out first?\n",
      "Yes that was n 1977 and it has been awesome since then\n",
      "Yes that is true. Do you know who played the role of Poe Dameron?\n",
      "Yes it was Oscar Isaac who is from Guatemala originally\n",
      "Yeah and so he requested that he be a native of planet Yarvin 4 as it is filmed in Guatemala\n",
      "Yeah. Did you know Lucas' wife changed things on the script and added stuff to it?\n",
      "Yes and she even won an OScar for that\n",
      "Yeah she deserved it, she added the Princess Leia good luck kiss in it\n",
      "True DO you like other science fiction movies?\n",
      "Yes I do actually, Did you know NASA has a list of terms that writers can use?\n",
      "WOw nice. And they named Gattaca as the most accurate movie of all time scientifically \n",
      "Nice. Did you know the MIT science fiction society has a lifetime membership?\n",
      "Yeah and then if you die and come back there is another one\n",
      "Wow cool. Did you know Deep Roy is the only one to hold the science fiction trifecta?\n",
      "Yeah he appeared in Doctor WHo, Star Trek and Star Wars\n",
      "Yeah. Have you ever been to a fan convention?\n",
      "I have not but I hear they are extremely lucrative for the industry overall\n",
      "It sure is. Actors can earn more than 100 000 for just a weekend\n",
      "WOw that is a lot of money ad more than their salaries in movies\n",
      "Yes so it is a great way for them to make some extra\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good morning.  Do you like Walt Disney movies?\n",
      "Yes I love Walt Disney and the movies that you made, one of my favorites is Sleeping Beauty, what about you?\n",
      "I watch so many growing up.  How about the COmputer that Wore Tennis SHoes? I liked many of the recycled animations for the 1970s. \n",
      "Haha I never saw that one. I did think that the movie Frozen was ok, I never knew it was the first Disney movie to be directed by a woman though\n",
      "The did all kinds of things.  The Lion King was dubbed into Zulu for its release in Africa. \n",
      "Well that makes sense because Zulu is an African language. It's interesting that toy manufacturers actually contact Disney before movies are even being made, assuming it's because they want to make the most money with the toys\n",
      "Speaking of movies, have you seen DeadPool 2?  The video game cost more to make than the original movie.\n",
      "I did see that movie. I liked the first one more, I also played the video game as well! What about you?\n",
      "I've seen the first one and it was funny and different from the other superhero movies. I didn't realize it was the highest grossing R rated film of all time that was not directed by Cameron or Lucas.\n",
      "Yeah that is impressive. I like how in the comics they alluded to Deadpool looking like \"Ryan Reynolds crossed with a Shar-Pei\", and then they actually got Ryan Reynolds to be the role in real life haha\n",
      "He also was the voice of the \"mystery villain\".  Reynolds is pretty versatile. \n",
      "I don't remember the mystery villain part, do you? I think the best part of Deadpool 2 was Josh Brolin how he played cable is awesome!\n",
      "I haven't seen the 2nd one.  I do know DP 2 was directed by David Leitch.  I wonder if he directed the 1st one?\n",
      "No it was a different director. I don't know why they got rid of the first director for the second movie though. I do like David Fincher and James Cameron, they both Champion the project which is good because otherwise it might not have been made\n",
      "I wonder it that affected the quality of DP 2?  Have you seen Guardians of the Galaxy?\n",
      "Yes I saw that movie. I like the first one a lot. Chris Pratt is awesome! What about you what did you think\n",
      "I'm really not into the superhero genre.  I do admire ad libbing.  I guess a line from Mary Poppins was ad libbed in GG 2.  Bravo!\n",
      "That was a good line! Funny that they were going to do a six pack on Chris Pratt with CGI ABS LOL I guess that turned out not to be necessary\n",
      "Yeah, who cares... China and Taiwan renamed GG to \"Interplanetary Unusual Attack Team.\"  A mouthful that's kinda odd...\n",
      "That is very odd. Do you remember if James Gunn is going to be the director for the third movie? I know there was some controversy with a post he made on Twitter, and he directed the first two, so it would be weird if he didn't direct the last one\n",
      "I really don't know.  You were excellent!  Thanks for the chat!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you think of self-censorship on platforms like Twitter?\n",
      "I'm not a big fan, but it's always to be looked at in many different ways.  How about you?\n",
      "I think it exposes the fallacy that everyone can just be themselves, truly expressive, on such platforms.  If the mob can \"get you\" for saying something, then it's not free.  With an edgy content creators like Dan Harmon having to apologize ... it's really plain to see.\n",
      "Yeah too much pc is lame for me, to me you should be able to create whatever content you want and if its bad then its bad and people wont like it because it sucks.  \n",
      "Right.  Isn't that the purpose of \"downvoting\" anything ... Or not seeing a movie you don't like?  I never saw deadpool because I don't want to.  It's rated R, and that's not my thing, especially with my family.  I don't protest the theaters.\n",
      "Exactly, free will is a good thing and should keep it that way.  I don't go to see most of the superhero movies because I don't think they are good, I don't protest. \n",
      "Do you think that there is an element where such shaming's should be employed?  Would it be crossing the line if I said humiliating criminals who have committed heinous crimes should be allowed? What do you think?\n",
      "Im up for free content creation for whatever, unless it is supporting to do some sort of criminal behavior like organizing a mob to riot or something. \n",
      "That makes sense.  So if Harmon was trying to recruit time travelers to do what he was showing ... that would be bad enough?\n",
      "Yeah who knows, but you know how sensitive people are even to stuff that isn't remotely bad. \n",
      "Is there a way, do you think, to reverse this trend?  Or do you think it's going to get worse, and famous people will just start to quit or neuter their social media?\n",
      "I think it will just continually get worse.  People are more and more PC each day.  You really can't have an opinion unless it's the right one these days. \n",
      "Yes ... sad.  What opinion of yours would you share on social media if you felt you wouldn't be mobbed?\n",
      "That is a very good question.  I don't think I know.  Maybe just how PC everything has become and that you really can't have an opinion or express it without being hated by someone. \n",
      "Hahaha, good point.  It's even \"offensive\" to say that things are too PC!  I think there might be more variety coming out of hollywood (tv and movies) if censorship like this wasn't a concern.  We're going on Toy Story 8? (jk) Disney just plays it safe, like getting rid of Rosanne.\n",
      "Yeah I agree with you on that.  I feel like what Jerry Seinfeld said was the best, I don't go on skin color, I go on what's funny, that's it.  To which he got attacked naturally. \n",
      "(sigh) I wish I could get behind things like cultural appreciation events, but I fear they may be run by the same people who would be offended most often.  Like anyone with \"diversity\" in their professional title, you know?  I'll be ABC, Disney, everyone at the studio level has some officer for that.\n",
      "Exactly, good call yeah.  I had to do a report and speech in college way back on affirmative action.  I just couldn't get over the fact that the 'best person for the job' mentality wasn't true, or is true for me but not what was being practiced.  I don't think it's right to exclude anyone for anything not based on skills, performance, and experience. \n",
      "I wonder sometimes how our period in history will be remembered ... and if any of this will come up.  I believe it's a critical element, but I've never read anything on this level about other generations.\n",
      "Good call, I wonder that myself, and I don't think there is much information well not as much as today where everything and everyone is being recorded or photographed or anything they say as well. \n",
      "True.  Historians will have a lot to sift through.  If only there were a fair way to sort it all ... Good talking with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a Walt Disney fan?\n",
      "Hello.  Not so much, but my kids watch some of their stuff.  It's hard not to with them being one of the big six film studios.\n",
      "Me too!  ...and I agree!  Disney's Lion King was the first movie of theirs to be dubbed in Zulu for the African release.\n",
      "I didn't know that.  Did Pixar make the movie because it is animated?  I think they own Star Wars too which is one of my favorite movie series.  \n",
      "I'm not sure.  I do know though that Disney owns Star Wars so you're correct there.  During the 70s Disney recycled their animation cells, which resulted in having identical scenes in some movies.  I never knew that nor did I catch it.  I think my kids had every Disney movie ever made up to a few years ago.\n",
      "That's cool.  They sure do have big budgets for their films.  Did you know they originally wanted The Beatles to voice the four vultures in \"The Jungle Book\"\n",
      "I didn't know that.  That would have been interesting.  Frozen was the first animated Disney movie directed by a woman.\n",
      "That doesn't surprise me.  I wonder if the same director will do Frozen 2?  The technology they have to make their movies is amazing too.  Even on their older films like Bambi they used a special multiplane camera to make them look more realistic.\n",
      "I agree!  I bet they will use the same director.  If they are smart, they would try to recapture the vibe of the first movie.\n",
      "For sure, it was such a hit.  Deadpool was a huge hit too.  I liked the first one but haven't seen Deadpool 2 yet.  Have you?  I'm not a big fan of the X-Men series, but do like these films.\n",
      "I thought the first Deadpool was really good...and I haven't seen the 2nd one yet.  I'm not big on them either.  I find the story of how Deadpool described himself in the comic book series.  Do you know who he described himself as?\n",
      "No, I'm not sure.  Who?\n",
      "Deadpool described himself in the 2004 comic book series as \"Ryan Reynolds crossed with a shar-pei\".  It led to Ryan believing he was destined to play the role.  \n",
      "That's really funny.  I didn't know that.  I know it took him 11 years to get Deadpool made in his own vision.\n",
      "I know righ!\n",
      "I might need to see Deadpool 2 soon.  It might be worth it just to see Matt Damon's cameo appearance.\n",
      "I didn't know he was in it! lol  The Deadpool video game cost more to make than the Deadpool movie!\n",
      "Wow, that's amazing!  I had no idea that was the case.  Big bucks to be spent for entertainment I suppose and cross promotion.  Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack reached number on the US Billboard 200 chart.\n",
      "That was a huge movie too!  I really like it as well!  I have to get going....I enjoyed chatting with you.\n",
      "Same here, take care.\n",
      "You too!  have a good day!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you seen Deadpool 2?\n",
      "Um no i have not. have you?\n",
      "No but I saw the first one and it's supposed to be very similar to the first one.  I guess Reynolds does the voices of others as well as doing the main character.\n",
      "really? i did not know that. he is a talented guy.\n",
      "He is funny.  Did you know that the Lion KIng was dubbed to Zulu for its release in Africa?\n",
      "I did not, but that makes sense. disney is doing a good job marketing its movies to new audiences.\n",
      "They always have it seems.  They make money... The toy industry gets involved even before film production.\n",
      "the film is just the first step in the marketing campaign. the brand has a life of its own.\n",
      "Have you seen Guardians of the Galaxy? There is an ad libbed Mary Poppins line in it.\n",
      "there is? that is funny. I have not seen the film. is that one with Chris whatshis name?\n",
      "Pratt. I don't know.  I know James Gunn wanted him so bad he was willing to use CGI to give him a fake six-pack. \n",
      "that is great! man, a fake six pack! i would love to have that in real life! is james gunn the guy that got in trouble for something with disney?\n",
      "I have no idea. What is Rick and Morty all about?\n",
      "isnt that an animated show with a scientist and a kid? lots of potty mouth and surreal plots?\n",
      "Now that you mention it, yes.  I guess it was created by a guy named Dan Harmon.  Like Gunn he's in some controversy with his creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "controversy is good. it sells films. it draws attention .GotG probalby did better because of controversy.\n",
      "Not Gunn's kind.  He was tweeting jokes about things like rape and pedophilia.  Really not funny...\n",
      "i guess he crossed the line. sometimes people make jokes and dont realize that it needs to be reined in. is he a good director?\n",
      "Harmon got off easier since he worked for an employer that's more comfortable about edgy topics. \n",
      "If i am chosen to direct one of the GotG films, i will be sure to watch my tweets. Lesson learned! Anyway, great chat!\n",
      "So many getting in trouble with Tweets... Thanks!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, do you like the Avengers: Infinity movie?\n",
      "I havnt seen that one yet. I do like the avengers though. Me and my son love movies like that.\n",
      "Nice. It was the first movie that was filmed with digital imax cameras only\n",
      "Did you know that the avengers caused a notable increase in shawarma sales?\n",
      "Nice, that is pretty cool. The guy who plays Jarvis in Iron Man and Avengers is never seen\n",
      "You mean he has never even seen the films right? I heard that.\n",
      "Yeah, type there sorry. I wonder if he has a good reason behind that. Do you know who Lou Ferrigno is?\n",
      "Yeah he used to voice the hulk back in the day. I think.\n",
      "Yeah and he still does the vice and has done so since then. peaking of other celebrities, do you like Serena WIlliams? DO you watch tennis?\n",
      "I dont really wathc tennis, but I do know who serena williams is. \n",
      "Nice. She won her 23rd grand slam while she was pregnant\n",
      "That is amazing. She is really a good role model for young girls to look up to.\n",
      "For sure. She is also a business woman and co-owns Miami Dolphins\n",
      "Thats good to know. I would say that is a pretty sound investment. \n",
      "I think so too. And she speaks 3 languages fluently, as does her sister Venus\n",
      "Wonder how she learned all those languages. It isnt really that common for somebody to know more than two languages.\n",
      "Yeah, she is just a very well rounded person I guess. Do you know when she first reached number 1 ranking?\n",
      "I believe it was on July 8 2002.\n",
      "Yeah, and she has just looked up since then. She has been number one for 319 weeks\n",
      "I heard that. On her sixth time at number one she held it for 186 consecutive weeks. What a competitor.\n",
      "Yeah she just does not give up In 2007 she was ranked at 95th place and went on to beat SHarapova and win the Australian Open\n",
      "That is truly amazing. I dont know if there will ever be another athlete like her.\n",
      "Well it is going to be pretty difficult to fill her shoes. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you see the Avengers?\n",
      "Yes. I've seen all of the marvel movies. they have done such a good job with them. Have you?\n",
      "yes!  Love them.  What a sequel huh?  It had so many heros to keep count.  Marvel is awesome.\n",
      "They have just been amazing with all the things they have done with it. They have really made some of those actors into superstars. \n",
      "I did not know the Guardian of the Galaxy and the Avengers were from the same era!\n",
      "I didn't know that either. I love the tie ins that they do like Lou Ferrigno being included in all of them up to age of ultron. \n",
      "I was actually a little disappointed that the hulk did not play that much of a role in Infinity.\n",
      "me too. I heard they might be setting it up to have it be loki pretending to be the hulk. That would be an amazing twist. \n",
      "Oh my...that would be crazy.  Did you know it was all shot with digital imax cameras?\n",
      "That makes sense they are trasitioning to that. They are starting to release them in 3D and IMAX first. Certainly makes for a great movie!\n",
      "Maybe the guy who plays jarvis will actually watch one!\n",
      "I wonder if maybe he doesn't so that he change his performace by critiquing the way he did things. He still does an amazing job with the character\n",
      "I wouldnt be able to resist.   I would want to see Scarlett Johansson over and over again!\n",
      "I really hope they are going to come out with the black widow movie like they keep talking. That would make for an amazing origin movie!\n",
      "I do too, hope no Kardasians are in it, lol.\n",
      "I would rewatch avengers over and over again rather than ever watch any of that reality tv garbage. I don't understand why they are famous. \n",
      "They latched on to Paris Hilton and spun off from there.  Full of drama.\n",
      "It is just ridiculous.The whole trailblazer in selfie things makes me roll my eyes so hard. Selfish was certainly a good title for something like that. \n",
      "haha, yes agreed.  it is appropriately titled selfish though.\n",
      "Hopefully this whole pop culture phenomenon fades sometime very soon. \n",
      "Yes I agree, have a good night.  Nice talking to you.\n",
      "Yes it was a very good conversation!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you doing on this fine Internet day?\n",
      "Im doing good. How about you.\n",
      "I'm great! Do you follow tennis at all?\n",
      "Not really The only tennis players I even know anything about are the Williams sisters.\n",
      "I don't watch tennis much. I think it's funny that Serena and Venus  said they could beat any man ranked 200 or worse in a game of tennis. karsten braasch, ranked 203, accepted the challenge and easily beat them, 6-1, 6-2. Didn't work out how they thought.\n",
      "Lol, that is kind of funny. Got to like someone with confidence to say something like that though.\n",
      "They put their money where their mouths were. Why do the Williams sisters speak French and Italian? Did they have tutors? Amazing!\n",
      "If I remember right I think their dad was in the military and they were stationed overseas much of their lives. Dont quote me on that though.\n",
      "that would make sense. Pick up the language in the country and on the court. They rose so quickly, too. Serena Williams was ranked 95th in the world but went on to win the Australian Open against Sharapova.\n",
      "Yeah, Venus was kind of always in her sisters shadow, though she was pretty good herself. Serena has actually been ranked number one for 319 total in her career. Thats third best in the Open Era among female players.\n",
      "Serena Williams is a co-owner of the Miami Dolphins. I always wondered what she did with that prize money. It's a smart investment.\n",
      "Well I dont know about buying into the Dolphins. Lol. Could have picked a better team. It is a smart investment though. You know the NFL is making a lot of money.\n",
      "Probably, but is she based in Miami? Does she have ties? Also, I wonder how many teams are looking for new owners to add. There might not be many opportunities. I dunno.\n",
      "That probably is the case, Im not sure though. It would make sense. I also doubt to many NFL team owners are looking to sell shares of the team either. I wonder if the Kardashians own any part of any professional sports teams. They probably have the money to buy in.\n",
      "I was just thinking about that. The Kardashians are exactly the kind of poeple to get in on NFL ownership. Probably be irritating to fans, too. I don't follow them, but they show up incessantly.\n",
      "Im with you on that. I dont understand the fascination with them. I know they are rolling in the doe though. Cant hate them for it.\n",
      "When the Williams sisters got fame and money, it was because of work and talent. Kim Kardashian? What did she every do? \n",
      "I guess she married a couple rappers and was the personal assistant to Paris Hilton. I am not saying I think she is deserving of everything she gets, I just cant be mad at her for running with it.\n",
      "Life is not just. Many people get money for just being born into rich families. She got lucky. Anyway, I enjoyed chatting!\n",
      "Yeah I agree. For someone to make 53 million dollars for being a reality tv star is just crazy to me. Im gonna have to get off here though. TTYL\n",
      "TTYL\n",
      "bye\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey what do you think of Kim Kardashian?\n",
      "I like her. I heard she was doing a lot of PR work for the new Yeezys.\n",
      "That is cool. I knew her and Paris Hilton were friends but I didn't know she was Paris's assistant and stylist. \n",
      "Yes, that's cool. Do you see the Avengers: Infinity War?\n",
      "No, I never got around to it, I heard it was really good though.\n",
      "Yes, it is. It's a 2018 superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers and was produced by Marvel Studios. It was also distributed by Walt Disney Studios.  It's actually a sequel to the 2012's Avengers and 2015 Avengers: Age of Ultron.\n",
      "Wow, the movies have been going on for awhile now. I heard that the voice of hulk is the same person since the 1970's tv series.\n",
      "Cool, did you hear that Hugin and Munin, Odin Raven's appear in the Avengers film during Thor and Loki's argument on the mountaintop. I actually have the Loki T-shirt.\n",
      "That is really cool, I'm sure it's an awesome t-shirt. The first Avengers Infinity War was the first film to ever be shot with imax cameras.\n",
      "Yes, it's an ok green T-shirt, nothing spectacular but it's funny.  Yes, and in the film, the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy attempt to stop Thanos from amassing the all-powerful Infinity Stones.\n",
      "It does sound great, I know my kids talk about Thanos a lot and pretend to have the gauntlet or whatnot. haha I don't know if you ever watched the show Recess, but the waitress captain america saves voiced Gretchen in Recess. \n",
      "No, I haven't seen that but I probably will at my cousin's house.  I did hear that Robert Downey Jr.  was on the set of the Avengers and he would hide food on the sets.\n",
      "Haha I wonder why he was hiding food?\n",
      "I don't know why he would do that but apparently nobody was ever able to find it so they let him continue to do it. The scenes where he is eating blueberries and shawarma are unscripted and are part of the collection of food that he hid. Maybe they'll make a video game of it and put it in there as part of the role playing of his character.\n",
      "That is hilarious! He seems like a cool guy.\n",
      "Yes, I like Robert Downey Jr., too. Actually, did you know that Hollywood uses a measurement called 'q' scores to determine the likability of celebrities?\n",
      "No I had no idea that was a thing, it's kind of ridiculous. Speaking of celeberties, Fall out boy had Kim Kardashian in their music video!\n",
      "She certainly is popular even though according to her \"q score\" in Hollywood, its the lowest one at -71.\n",
      "Wow, I guess many people don't like her \n",
      "maybe her reality TV personality attitude sometimes. \n",
      "True, that show is crazy. Well it was nice talking to you, I've got to get to bed! goodbye!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you into superhero films like the Avengers?  It's a Marvel Comics creation.\n",
      "Very much so.  Infinity War was one of my favorites.  Did you know that the Avengers caused a increase in shawarma sales?  I do not know what that is!\n",
      "Me either.  I do know the Infinity Ware is the latest.  Have you seen it?\n",
      "Yes.  The suspenseful ending has me wondering how they will turn it around.  But, Marvel Comics never ceases to amaze me, so I sure it will be good.  Did you know that Infinity Wars was the first film to be shot entirely with digital IMAX cameras?  That explains why it was so realistic in 3D!\n",
      "I didn't know that.  I do know that I have never watched Kim Kardashian.  I also don't know what to think of Kanye West. \n",
      "I have never understood the reality TV celeb phenomena.  What has she really done that is worthy of being famous?  Being Paris Hilton's personal assistant and travel companion / stylist?\n",
      "I couldn't agree more.  I guess they are interesting in much the same way freak shows are.  She was in a Fall Out Boy music video (yawn). \n",
      "I never heard of the video, and I guess I am glad.  You have to wonder at time at if their relationships are real are created for the ratings?  Obviously she and Kanye have had children, so their is at least a little something to the relationship.  But is a bit of love and a lot of business or vice versa?  Obviously money making is key in their relationship.\n",
      "Kayne does a lot of things for ratings.  I wonder if he really likes Trump for example.  I didn't realize Kim Kardashian's dad was a lawyer on OL's Dream Team.\n",
      "She gotten her seed money  as inheritance from her father.  I was in an airport waiting on a flight with Ellen show on the gate waiting area TV.  Ellen describe Kardashian as a \"self made business woman\".  I choked on my soda.  How can you be self made when you inherit millions?  Now, Serena Williams - that is a self-made superstar!\n",
      "Amen.  Yes, she actually has ability and not \"Dad\" paving the way for her. \n",
      "I like the way she won the 2007 Australian Open as an underdog.  She went in ranked 95th and won against the great Maria Sharapova.  \n",
      "Yep. She was two months pregnant when she won her 23rd Grand Slam tournament. So much talent there...\n",
      "And, I think she is one of the few to follow-up with a win after giving birth.   She has been ranked No.1 for 319 weeks which ranks her third among the all time female tennis greats!\n",
      "I was surprised to learn that she is a co-owner of the Miami Dolphins.  I wonder if she even likes football or if it's an investment.\n",
      "I did not know that.  I'm not sure if football is the best investment these days, considering its declining viewership and being embroiled in the \"kneeling\" controversies.  But, maybe in the long haul, it will pan out.  Which brings us back to the Kardashians.  Why are they such a phenomena when they have done little themselves?  Seems like tens of millions follower her on social media, hanging on her every word.\n",
      "Caitlyn Jenner when she was an accomplished athlete but the rest? She's made over $53M so far for what?  Society seems to have it's priorities wrong. \n",
      "Well, Time Magazine in 2015 included her in their list of 100 most influential people.  Again, I do not know why because she is simply \"famous for being famous\".  I guess being \"famous for being famous\" is enough to justify an audience with the President and a full page letter in the New York Times!\n",
      "I don't get it... I did find out that shawarma is some kind of Middle Easter meat dish.  I have no idea what it has to do with the Avengers.\n",
      "I don't either except the Iron Man mentioned it in the closing of one of the movies.  Speaking of the Avengers, I believe the next installment is in theaters in April 2019.  I am really interested to see what Marvel has in store for us.  Have a good day!\n",
      "Thanks.  You were excellent.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a Cartoon Network fan?\n",
      "Not really, but the DC universe is pretty cool. Although some of their movies have no major super villans. \n",
      "Well, have you recently watched the newest movie of Transformers? I think it is called Bumblebee.\n",
      "I've seen them all, except the new one about Bumblebee, is it good? \n",
      "Bumblebee was all right. Not what I expected though.\n",
      "I liked the Batman movies, but the Justice League sucked I thought. I hear that they are making a new batman character. \n",
      "Batman had more action than Bumblebee, to be honest with you. I have not watched Justice League yet. Well, I hear that there are always new superhero characters for every upcoming relatable movie.\n",
      "I heard Superman was going to be voiced by Nicholas Cage and Tim Burton was set to direct, but the project was canceled. I think Nick Cage is the best actor ever.\n",
      "What about George Clooney? He was in Batman and Robin.\n",
      "Yeah, that was the worst Batman and Robin, that was the one with Arnold playing Mr. Freeze with his stupid Mr. Freeze puns. \n",
      "Speaking of superheroes, there are over 300 of them in the US. That is crazy.\n",
      "I've heard, I wonder if they all show up at Comic Con\n",
      "Maybe, they would be dressed up for sure in the upcoming San Diego Comic Con, which I will definitely go to this year!\n",
      "I would go to comic con, San Diego sounds warm. In sweden it is illegal to name your child metallica.\n",
      "Well, San Diego will be more hot than warm. Really? Is there a meaning behind it? Or does it mean that you should not call your child after a band?\n",
      "I'm not sure, apparently it was a big problem there for a long time. \n",
      "Maybe, it was a negative perspective to the Swedish.\n",
      "It could be, the writers for superman did not name their super villain or a preexisting word, they coined the term brainiac. \n",
      "However, what's crazy was that Superman was suppose to be a villain.\n",
      "I believe it, maybe Lex Luther was going to be the good guy for once!\n",
      "Also, superman's power was to disguise into anybody. All I could think of was him in his cape flying and saving the world. \n",
      "Yeah, that's crazy! Nice talking to you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi there! I am wondering if you are familiar with superheroes? At one time there was a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by them.\n",
      "I am not a die-hard super hero fan but I do enjoy a couple! X-men and batman mainly. Do you have any favorites?\n",
      "I really like Batman. Can you believe Adam West has a Batman logo on one of his molars?\n",
      "haha no! that is hard to believe. but now i need to see it for myself! Did you know about the condiment king?? I can't believe that was a real villan for batman!!\n",
      "No! I never heard of that!! Did you know WEird Al Yankovich did voice over work in the most recent DC animated film Batman vs. Robin.\n",
      "yeah it's too weird  lol definitely a different world back then. Did you watch the 60s TV series? such a hoot! Bruce Wayne is the best Robin i think\n",
      "I did a little bit. Do you know neither Batman nor Joker refer to one another by name.\n",
      "Yeah well Joker not saying it makes sense since no one knows who Batman is! I think the same goes for the Joker actually like in Dark Knight he gives 3 different stories to how he got his smile scars. Are you into Superman at all??\n",
      "I like Superman. In Sweden it is illegal to name your child Superman. Now stop laughing!\n",
      "ha yeah. I don't know why anyone would! Weird to think he used to be able to change himself. Do you know how long ago that was??\n",
      "I think it is a standing rule. Did you see the comic where Superman was once bitten by Dracula, but because the man of steel is fueled by the sun, Dracula immediately exploded.\n",
      "No no I never even knew that dracula crossed over into that universe! Wonder what that was like. He's fueled by the sun but do u remember what hurts him??\n",
      "I do not. At one point the Superman character had the power of facial contortion allowing him to disguise himself as anyone. \n",
      "Yeah it's weird that he used to be able to change himself. It might be because he was supposed to be a villan. Maybe that's why him and batman have some kind of beef. Do you have a favorite superhero movie??\n",
      "Very weird. I am not sure. Maybe one of the Batman ones. I guess I like the idea that Gotham City is located in New Jersey according to DC Cannon.\n",
      "Yeah that's weird to find out. I always thought it was Chicago but probably cause they film there for the Nolan movies lol. I wonder how people can actually register themselves as a superhero. Can you believe there is 300 people registered??\n",
      "Yeah maybe. And no, that is weird. Did you know that unlike most superheroes, Batman has no superpowers, but instead relies on his genius intellect.\n",
      "Yeah it's pretty crazy! No super powers and he can still basically fly. Although he does have some good help :) Speaking of batman vs superman. Who would you pick Wonder Woman or Catwoman??\n",
      "I think Wonder Woman. Although I do not know a whole lot about either.\n",
      "Yeah I'm not sure either. Did you see her movie?\n",
      "I did not. I'[ll have to look into it. It was great chatting today. Bye!\n",
      "Okay have a good day. good bye\n",
      "Bye\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello! Do you like super hero movies?\n",
      "I love superhero movies. I loved the batman trilogy. How about you?\n",
      "I do! I watch them with my kids, they are in love with Batman haha\n",
      "That is great! I like superman too, especially in films, did you like the new justice league movie?\n",
      "I loved The Justice League! Stan Lee was so amazing! Still is.\n",
      "Right, it is sad he passed away, but he will always be remembered! Stan Lee wrote 15 comics for dc\n",
      "He will be missed dearly, but his amazing superhero movies will keep his memory alive forever. \n",
      "For sure, it was so nice he was in all of the marvel ones. Too bad he didn't make an appearance once or twice in some dc as an honor for those 15 comics\n",
      "Right? That would have been awesome. I have to say Superman is one of my favorites and Batman. Do you have an all time favorite?\n",
      "I like the flash so much. His show was great. I didn't like flash in the justice league, they could have done better. what do you think?\n",
      "I do like Flash, and I have to agree with you on that. They could have done better for sure. Did you know there are over 300 registered superheroes? Just in the USA!\n",
      "Like real life superheroes? or comic book ones?\n",
      "I would guess in the comics, lol, it didn't say. Ya never know where a superhero will pop up haha!\n",
      "Right, I think i saw a show one time on real life ones, so it made sense lol. One of my favorite superheroes is garfield!\n",
      "Right! I have heard there is a book series called Pet Force! Did you read the books?\n",
      "I have not, is that the one with garfield in it with the group of superheroes? \n",
      "Yes it is :) I should try and find that series. Also there is a superhero that is called Normalman....the only normal person in a world of all superhero's lol, he has no super powers...but he is considered a superhero hahaaa\n",
      "I have to tell you something.... I am normalman, the most normal of any human being possible. Don't tell anyone! lol\n",
      "HAHAHA, your secret is safe with me! Just don't be like the one villain in Batman named condiment king...and get defeated by slipping in your ketchup!\n",
      "lol, I wonder how he came up with that or what is power was. a cool name is brainiac, like in superman\n",
      "I like that...brainiac, sounds tough lol, Did you know Gotham city is located in New Jersey? Who knew haha\n",
      "I would never have guessed that. It was so nice talking to you, have a good night!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good evening. Do you like film? Cinematography in ancient greece actually translates to movement.\n",
      "Yes i love film.  Wow thats good to know. I hear no woman has ever been nominated for the academy award for best cinematography\n",
      "I guess they prefer to be in the shot of the camera! James Wong accomplished a lot as he pioneered the use of wide angle lenses!\n",
      "thats interesting.  Do you like robots?\n",
      "Yes I think they are interesting. They can debone a chicken with high precision.\n",
      "That is amazing,  and kinda gross lol I hear robots can be controlled by rat brains lol \n",
      "Whoa that is creepy to think about lol. Interesting that the robot will change personality with different brains!\n",
      "I think thats really cool,  soon they will try and put different human brains in it lol \n",
      "Yes I am kind of scared for that moment. The military uses xbox 360 controllers to control eod robots. Good publicity for Microsoft!\n",
      "Do you like insects?\n",
      "Oh yeah they are fascinating. There are these bugs that actually breath in dissolved gold and excrete solid gold!\n",
      "Wow,  that is amazing lol It sounds painful though lol \n",
      "Lol it does indeed. Have you ever seen those tiny red bugs on bricks? They are called clover mites.\n",
      "Oh I havent but I have heard of them.  I cant believe there is a massive highway in the sky thats transports bugs, even spiders.  How does that even happen they cant fly lol\n",
      "Yes I don't understand that. Billions of bugs per day? I do not want to be in the middle of that highway!\n",
      "Yeah lol sounds gross lol apparently if you see ingredients on food boxes that say carmine, cochineal extract or natural red 4,  the product contains crushed bugs!!!!  why do food comapnies do this?  they dont have any other filler for food but bugs?  who even thought that this is ok\n",
      "No way!! I will look out for that ingredient, thanks for telling me. Have you heard about the dinocampus coccinellae wasp? It turns ladybugs into zombie babysitters! \n",
      "what are zombie babysitters? lol \n",
      "I think it basically keeps them alive so they don't die but they can't really move and the baby wasps just get shelter and food. I learned about it on a show once. Pretty messed up. It was great talking with you today.\n",
      "great talking to you as well thanks for the info\n",
      "No problem. I much prefer the \"gold bugs\" to those wasps. Have a good one!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hollywood is getting more creative when it comes to superhero movies.  The Teen Titans go to the Movies is funny and based on the cartoon tv show\n",
      "Yeah, I never really took it seriously but it has grown on me. \n",
      "It is pretty funny and harmless fun.  Not as good as Aquaman though.\n",
      "I havent watched Aquaman yet! Apparently there are good songs in the Teen Titans Go movie too.\n",
      "There were.  They had an amazing voice cast for the film.  A lot of good guest stars\n",
      "I like comedy so I think I'd like the silly humor in the movie. I have heard that it's a laugh a minute ride.\n",
      "Yeah, and they make fun of a lot of DC movies in the film too.  Like Batman vs Superman\n",
      "It's cool they don't take themselves too seriously.\n",
      "I just wish they would make a decent superman movie again.  He has been in films since 1940s but it has been too long since a good one was made\n",
      "Yeah, superman is cool. He was originally supposed to be a villain.\n",
      "I am glad they made him a hero instead.  It set up the entire DC universe\n",
      "And he originally had the power of facial contortion so he could disguise himself as anyone. What do you think of that?\n",
      "I think that might be a little too much.  He can already fly and shoot lasers out of his eyes.  Plus everything else he can do\n",
      "I totally agree. So is Dracula dead forever? Because Superman was bitten by Dracula but because Superman is fueled by the sun, Dracula exploded.\n",
      "Maybe...vampires do not really do well in the sun.  \n",
      "What about Batman, do you like him?\n",
      "I do.  I used to wish I was Robin as a kid so I could help batman fight the joker\n",
      "Aw, that's cute. Why do Joker and Batman never refer to each other by name in face to face confrontations, btw?\n",
      "I don't know.  Maybe they use pet names.  They have known each other for a while.  \n",
      "Have you heard of condiment king?\n",
      "Yeah, he is not quite as imposing as the Joker.  Been good talking with you.  \n",

      "Right?! It seems only a few are recognized repeatedly\n",
      "Must be, yeah! That poor guy who has been nominated 13 times...\n",
      "He is like the Leonardo DiCaprio of cinematography\n",
      "It's true! Surprised by the idea that robots can change their personality depending on which rat brain is used, interesting!\n",

      "I don't even think I could debone a chicken, especially not with surgical precision! I feel like we're definitely on the path to certain professions becoming obsolete because of robots. Like surgeons, apparently.\n",
      "I think there will always need to be a human element in it to make decisions but I know from personal experience robotic surgery saves lives\n",
      "That's a good point, it does get dicey without the element of empathy. But yeah, definitely believe that it can save lives. \n",
      "Now if only they could invent a robot to get rid of those clover mites. They are horrible in the summer\n",
      "Agree! I've always seen them but didn't know what they were called. The gold bugs sound cool though,\n",
      "Yes they do. I wonder how big they are.\n",
      "Me too! Interesting that they live underwater too\n",
      "seems like you can't escape bugs anywhere from the ocean to the sky\n",

      "Soccer is the international sport. Women around the world will be keen on seeing the games. Not so much for baseball, I guess. I am not a big baseball fan, though I follow the playoffs.\n",
      "I'm not a sports person, I do like chess. Although, I didn't know it was invented in India.\n",
      "Chess is a very old game. The term \"checkmate\" means something about the king dying.\n",
      "It's funny that the current president of the World Chess Federation believes it was invented by aliens.\n",
      "Yes, that makes sense. Because nothing about the game seems remotely human in origin. LOL. The game appeals to a certain type of thinker.\n",
      "Yes, it does. One with a moderately high IQ, lol. There are so many moves, more so than the number of atoms in the universe. It's a mentally exhausting game.\n",
      "It seems that people show talent for the game at a young age. I've heard though that there is an inverse correlation between IQ and chess ability in strong players. That's probably a flaw in the IQ tests, which won't measure the kind of thinking that chess players do.\n",
      "I think so too, especially with all of the kids who are masters at it before they reach double digits. Like that Grandmaster Judit Polgar.\n",
      "I wonder what attracts the players to the game. Perhaps it's the complexity, or maybe the chance to create your own personal style.\n",
      "For many, I would say it's family influence. The game has such a rich history.\n",
      "I suppose talent could run in the family. I wonder what kind of personality you would need: spending hours inside your head, thinking of the moves and countermoves. \n",
      "Kind of like how athletic ability seems to run in families. Though, that doesn't explain why the Red Sox have lost every game on Ben Afflecks birthday. That's so bizarre.\n",
      "Well, the universe was probably telling him something about his film career and role choices. The Chicago Cubs are another cursed team.\n",
      "After this many years, one would think he would take the hint. Are they really? I never knew that, just like both the Red Sox and Liverpool F.C are owned by the same investment company.\n",
      "I know that the Red Sox are partly owed by the New York Times, the paper of the city that's Boston's biggest rival.\n",
      "It's a small world, investment wise. Fenway park is a beautiful stadium though.\n",
      "I've never been. The Sox have been there since 1912. \n",
      "I've never been to a game, we were there to see the Pope, when I was a child. I do not understand why Babe Ruth had to cheat so much. Has anyone ever asked him why he did it?\n",
      "Lots of money in it, I guess? I know that he lost the 1926 World Series for his time when he was caught stealing a base. That would suck.\n",
      "It's amazing that the Cubs haven't won a world series, after their back-to-back wins. However, I'm from Cleveland, so I don't really have a right to criticize another town's teams.\n",

      "Sorry had caps lock on. Did you know there are more possible moves in chess than there are atoms in the know universe.\n",
      "Not sure I have ever counted the atoms in the universe.  Give me a minute or two. It would be fun to see the early versions of the game from India.\n",
      "Yeah it would be cool to find an old chess game from that era. Chess was actually invented in India and the improved upon by the persians.\n",
      "It is kind of funny that war helped spread chess, a game of simulated war.  The game reached Europe in the 9th century.  It would be boring to not have chess around.\n",
      "It sure would. Grandmaster of chess judit pulgar once beat a family friend without looking when he was only 5 years old.\n",
      "Grandmaster Judit Polgar once stepped out of his house and got the snot beat out of him for having a weird name. Do you believe in aliens?\n",

      "The president of the world chess federation believes that chess was invented by aliens.  Skully and Molder are on the way, but they need to buy a pac of cigs for the cancer man.\n",
      "I don't know about that. I guess scientist found a negative correlation between IQ and chess skill. \n",
      "Yes, the negative correlation might mean something like you're brain is really hardwired for chess, with less intellectual capacity leftover for other kinds of cognitive tasks. \n",
      "I dont believe I have. Do you ever watch the world series though.\n",
      "I have not watched the whole series.  Bits and pieces of games.  Current world series or strange history things?\n",
      "Did you know that babe ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 of the wrold seris of 1926.\n",

      "I do to. Im certainly not a cubs fan. Did you know that the womens world cup had more tv audience than the world series.\n",
      "Womens world cup soccer?  Hum  I had no idea.  I would bet that the baseball players (men) got paid more than the womens soccer players.\n",
      "Oh I guarantee it. Im not sure if they even get paid for being in the olympics though.\n",
      "World cup and olympics are two different things.  Did you see the Marines  color guard carry in the Canadian flag in 1992?  \n",
      "I did not realize that. I thought they were the same. My bad. I did see that though. They carried it in upside down. Im gonna have to be getting off here though. Have a good one.\n",

      "When was that, like 1886? In the 1992 series, the USMC carried the Canadian flag upside down. Oops!\n",
      "I don't know what year it was, just that they were the first team to win back to back World Series and they haven't won since.\n",
      "The World Series is popular in the US, but not around the world. In fact, the women's world cup gets a bigger TV audience. Maybe if they allowed women in the MLB, things would change.\n",
      "Yes, who knows!\n",
      "I think it's funny that the Red Sox have lost every game on Ben Affleck's birthday since 1997.\n",
      "Yes, and they're partially owned by the New York Times. That seems like a conflict of interest.\n",
      "The Times would want the Yankees to win, and the Sox to lose to sell more papers in the NY? LOL\n",
      "Who knows. Or they'd want the Sox to do well so there would be a lot of nail biters and good stories for the press. But in the end, the Sox would exist for the entertainment of New Yorkers, not Bostonians.\n",
      "Have you been to Fenway? It seems like a strange playing field. I imagine they didn't have much choice over the shape.\n",
      "I have never been there. It's interesting that Fenway Sports Group also owns the Liverpool FC. The Beatles home town sports team. I wonder if they are/were fans.\n",
      "There's a lot of money in European soccer. I guess it helps to diversity across sports and locations. \n",
      "Yes, I imagine.\n",
      "Soccer seems to be a game that's more fun to play than watch. I understand the appeal in countries where people grow up playing it. Recently some American got signed to a European team for a ton of cash. Maybe the following the US will change.\n",
      "Yes, possibly. Did you know that the president of the world chess federation believes that chess was invented by aliens? I mean, we're talking about international sports, but that would make chess inter-galactic.\n",
      "I wonder why aliens would need to be involved, especially since the game has distant historical origins. \n",
      "Exactly. It comes from an Indian game called chaturanga. So at what point were the aliens involved? Did they invent chaturanga? Or did they help it to evolve into chess? And how?\n",
      "Perhaps Indians are the direct descendants of aliens! I also wonder where these aliens came from, and why they gave us the game of chess. \n",
      "Yes. It sure leads to a lot of questions. Why would they give us a game modeled after a human monarchy? I mean, chess seems to refer to a specific area and time period. Was that when and where the aliens visited? Or was it an adaptation of the game after the aliens gave it to us?\n",
      "Maybe they wanted us to help in an interstellar war and chess was good training. Like the Last Starfighter. No one can know for sure until the interstellar war starts.\n",
      "How would chess work in space with less gravity?\n",
      "You would play with holographic images. Not physical pieces. Perhaps they would only exist in your mind.\n",
      "Yes! Because aliens use telepathy to communicate, apparently. Did you know that there are more possible moves in a chess game than atoms in the known universe? But what about the unknown universe?\n",
      "The unknown universe has the extra atoms to match the number of chess moves. The aliens are holding those atoms in reserve for the Great Galactic wars.\n",
      "Exactly! Well, on that thought, I'm off to prepare for the inter-galactic war. Have a good night!\n",

      "I am as well! My great grandfather was a fan even back when the Giants refused to face the Red Sox in the 1904 World Series.\n",
      "Yes, my family is longtime fans as well. Fenway Park is one of the two ballparks that have been in use for over 100 years.... Wrigley is the other.\n",
      "The Red Sox are certainly historic like that! It's one of the original eight American League charter franchises I believe. Funny to think it was technically called the \"Red Stockings\".\n",
      "Did you know that Lebron James is part of the group that owns the Red Sox?\n",
      "I did not! Is he part of the Fenway Sports Group? I believe they own both the Red Sox and Liverpool F.C., that's a lot of sports power.\n",
      "Yes that is correct. I know right! Did you know that in the 1904 world series that the Met's refused to play?\n",
      "I did! I wonder why that was, maybe they figured they would lose to Boston, after all the New York Highlanders lost to the Red Sox in their first game in 1913.\n",
      "Possibly, at least they are not as bad as the dodgers. They have lost more world series than any other team.\n",
      "Although maybe losing can be the key to being lucky in future success. Like the Chicago Cubs were the first team to win back to back World Series, but haven't won since.\n",
      "Oh wow that's true. Did you know that the Women's world cup has had higher ratings than the world series? \n",
      "I didn't! I wonder why that was, maybe it's because baseball is getting too old now? After all the last time the Chicago Cubs won the world series the Ottoman Empire was still in existence.\n",
      "Oh wow that's crazy!!! Did you know that prior to 1969 that the team with the best win-loss ration would go to the world series instead of doing play offs?\n",
      "I never knew that! I wonder if that's how a lot of older teams got good records. Maybe if they played by current rules the whole time, the American League wouldn't have 18 wins over the National League.\n",
      "I know they are pretty uneven. I thought out of the 114 world series they would have a more equal wins between the AL and NL.\n",
      "Exactly! I would have thought the same. Are you interested in other sports as well? I'm interested in chess as well.\n",
      "I like board games including chess. I know that boy scouts have a merit badge for chess and a few new other things.\n",
      "I didn't know that! It's interesting that it gets recognition like that, it's such an old sport, it was invented in India back during the Gupta Empire.\n",
      "Did you know each pawn used to have their own name? They were named after common occupations.\n",

      "Some of the Marvel ones, like Ironman 2 or 3, they have started to get repetitive to me. \n",
      "True, but other movies are part of a series like all the infinity stones\n",
      "Yeah, did you know there is a superhero called normalman? \n",
      "Isn't that the what if everyone is instead super or a premise something like that\n",
      "Yeah, pretty weird idea. Have you seen Mission Impossible? \n",
      "The series that made tom cruise famous right\n",
      "Yeah, it is pretty good. Tom Cruise made $75 million from one of them. \n",
      "I heard it was originally a tv show\n",
      "I'm not sure. That might be true. Apparently the first trailer was screened before Pokemon the Movie. \n",

      "It would surprise me. What do you think of Tom Cruise? \n",
      "Great actor\n",
      "I think he is good too, but nowhere near as rich as seinfeld. \n",
      "True but you can't deny he has left his mark since starting his career at 19\n",
      "This is true. Apparently he spent $10 million on a bunker. \n",

      "No! Too short! Marvel comics creator stan lee wrote 15 dc comics, re-imagining popular superheroes like batman and superman\n",
      "Well.. maybe, but he spent two years learning japanese swordplay and does many of his own stunts\n",
      "huh. I never really likes his movies except  War of the worlds. Some guys (successfully) pulled off a mission impossible style heist.\n",
      "jerry seinfeld's net worth is 820,000,000 more than tom hanks and tom cruise put together\n",
      "Wow! The first trailer to mission impossible ii was screened before the pokemon: the movie\n",
      "So you don't like Top Gun?\n",

      "you're not Tom Cruise are you? :) Cruise starred opposite Dustin Hoffman in the Academy Award for Best Picture-winning drama Rain Man.\n",
      "LMAO... NO!  He hung off the side of a plane at 5000 feet though\n",

      "lol ya I didn't like that movie, I do like Batman and Iron Man myself\n",
      "yeah, I agree with you on that. Iron Man series was pretty good. I didnt know that Garfield had a superhero series, should make a movie where Garfield takes on Black Panther. 2 cats enter, 1 cat leaves\n",
      "lol now that is a good idea for a crossover, it's weird that Stan Lee wrote 15 DC comics though, I know he was famous for creating Marvel characters\n",
      "Yeah thought he was only Marvel too\n",
      "have you heard of the superhero called normalman? he sounds interesting, he was born on a planet of superheros but has no superpowers\n",
      "Never heard of \"Normalman\". Would he be considered one the of 300 registered superheros in the United States?\n",
      "haha thats a good question cuz he has not superpowers! have you ever seen a Mission Impossible movie?\n",
      "yeah, I think I saw the last one. I usually try to watch those when they come out. Tom Cruise although a little \"kooky\" IMO still is a good actor.\n",
      "lol he is kind of weird, its crazy that he made 75 million for the 3rd movie\n",
      "yeah, that's a lot of money even for an actor. I knew he did some of his own stunts but climbing the tallest building without safety equipment, that's crazy\n",
      "that is crazy, he even hung off the side of an airplane at 5000 ft, he's definitely brave!\n",
      "I remember the old mission impossible series with I think his name was Peter Graves\n",
      "yes you're right, I remember the first movie came out in 1996, I think that was my favorite one\n",
      "yeah first one was really good. Who were the \"Some guys\" that pulled off a mission impossible style heist?\n",
      "haha ya I don't know i haven't herad of it, did you ever see pokemon the movie? apparently the trailer for Mission Impossible 2 was first shown before that movie\n",
      "I didnt know that. I never really got into Pokemon. I know that it's really popular, just never followed it. You see that Tom Cruise threatened to sue that hovercraft inventor \n",
      "haha wow didn't hear about that, I know that he plays Ethan Hunt in the Movies though, he does a great job in my opinion\n",
      "That's really surprising that Seinfeld has a net worth more than Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks combined.\n",
      "wow thats impressive! again though, Cruise seems kinda eccentric, he spent 10 million dollars on a bunker to protect himself from aliens lol\n",

      "Hi, Do you read comic books?\n",
      "Not for many years! And yourself?\n",
      "Nah, I learned some things about them recently, and it's more varied than I thought. Like ever heard of Normalman?\n",
      "Yes, sort of a regular guy with no powers. I just read that there are 300 registered super heros and I never knew that. I could probably name 12.\n",
      "I assume dthere would be hundreds more, there are so many comic books, like Antman, Waspman, such random guys.\n",
      "Yes, I suppose there are a lot. There are a lot of movies based on super heroes. When I was a kid I watched superman after school.\n",
      "Which is your favorite?\n",
      "I am not sure. I think I like Batman because he has that cool car. And I like Wonder Woman too.\n",
      "Do you prefer Marvel or DC? I heard they're very different styles of superhero.\n",
      "I guess Marvel because they are the only ones I remember from my childhood. How about you?\n",
      "I actually like one from Dark Horse that's about a Samurai, it's not exactly superhero though \n",
      "That's OK I used to love Archie. I was in grade school and they were all cool high school kids.\n",
      "Did you know there was a superhero comic about Garfield?\n",
      "I like Garfield. I didn't know that. He is a cool cat and so laid back.\n",
      "I always found it a little weird. But Odie was cute. Odie as a superhero would be fun\n",
      "I would read that. I like super heroes that are surprises-they look like Odie. I do not care for Tom Cruise, though.\n",
      "Yeah i really dislike him, I don't think he's a good actor. He got mad at this other guys for having a similar name to him.\n",
      "Good thing his name isn't John Smith, he would be mad all the time. Anyways, that's not his real name. It's Maypother.He looks like a Maypother too.\n",
      "That's bizarre, I have never heard that name before. I guess it wasn't cool enough for him.\n",
      "Actors should keep their real names. Except Meryl Streep. That is not a name I would want on a billboard.\n",
      "Very few of them do, or at least they didn't used to. I guess they want to be memorable.\n",
      "Maybe they think they will get more roles if they have a fancy name.\n",

      "Hey how is it going today? \n",

      "He must really care for the world around him.  Good for him!\n",
      "Yah, I didn't know he was in Critters 3, he was great in Titanic though.\n",
      "That was a good movie!  I liked him in Eating Gilbert Grape.  I was surprised he's been around that long.\n",
      "Yah, he's like a fine wine. I didn't know the Revenant was a remake of the 1971 film in the wilderness?\n",
      "I didn't know that.  He won a golden globe in 2004.\n",
      "A golden globe for what?\n",
      "He won it for Best Actor in a motion picture or comedy for Wolf of Wall Street.\n",
      "Didn't that come out in 2014? \n",
      "2012 or 2013 I believe.  That award he won was the only he has won.\n",
      "Right, do you have a man bun?\n",
      "I might if I was a man. :)  Did you see the movie Thor?\n",
      "I have, it was really good. Not to be awkward but the reason I asked about the hair was because of the hockey player that risked it all for his.\n",
      "How did he risk it all for his man bun?  That is hysterical.\n",
      "Oh it was because of some tradition on their team. He did pretty well after he did them and got 16 points in 42 games.\n",
      "Not bad.  I see hockey on my list but not that story.  A hockey players was traded for only 1 dollar in 1993 and went on to win 4 stanley cups.  I don't know his name though.\n",
      "I'm not sure where I saw that, I must have misread that article. I wonder what that is adjusted for inflation. I'm surprised they lose 8 pounds a game!\n",
      "Adjusted for inflation would probably be about a dime now.  I think gas was still hovering around 1 dollar a gallon around 1993 if I remember right.  Yes.  That is a lot of weight to lose for a game.  I should take up hockey.\n",
      "Haha me too, got to learn to skate first. I am going to take off though, great chatting with you.\n",
      "I need to learn to skate first too. Ha Nice to chat with you as well.\n",

      "Yes, he has held onto his long after they have gone away.The man bun craze peaked in 2015 so it is time to be done.\n",
      "I'm told he grimaces at the hair flapping out of his helmet, lol!\n",
      "Oh, okay. So did you know that in 1924 in the first Olympic games Canada scored 132 goals in the entire competition.\n",
      "Wow is that considered a lot i don't watch hockey?\n",
      "I would say a strong yes. In 1993 a hockey player was traded for $1 and went on to win 4 Stanley cups.\n",
      "Wow that sounds disgraceful but he showed them. So the hockey ring remains under the basketball court when switching stadiums. weird you think it be the other way around. \n",
      "He sure did! So, moving on, I like Leo Decaprio. He started on TV in 1980, and was born in '74 so he was just a little guy.\n",
      "Yeah he is a pronominal actor. Apparently he is producing a twilight zone movie. \n",
      "I like him. I did not realize he was a Growing Pains actor.\n",
      "Yeah he was the friend right?\n",
      "I think so. Are you a Thor fan? \n",
      "Yes indeed he is so funny, ive seen all three have you? \n",
      "I have not. What do you know about the show that would make me like it?\n",
      "Not familiar with any shows he's done but the Avengers is making history.\n",
      "Okay. If I am right he is a 2011 American superhero from Marvel.\n",
      "Yes i'm sorry i though you knew who he was. Yes he plays thor the god of thunder and if you haven't sen any of the movies you should. \n",
      "I was confused between him and another guy. Anyway, It was good chatting!\n",
      "You too, your going to love thor his got four films with marvel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I am quite surprised that Axel Johsson-Fjallby spends so much time worrying about his hair.\n",
      "Is that the guy playing Winger on the Capitals?\n",
      "Yeah. He thinks his hair is too long on the ice. If he cuts it, it will be too short for his man bun. Sometimes people really don't have enough real life things to worry about.\n",
      "Well, he's only 20 after all. I think everyone is fairly concerned with how they look at that age, right?\n",
      "I suppose you're right, especially if appearance plays a big role in their career. The man bun was all the craze in November of 2015 if you believe Google Trends.\n",
      "Oh yeah, a whole bunch of celebrities got in on it. Leo DiCaprio, Jared Leto... I know there were others...\n",
      "He has a lot of other things to focus on trying to adjust to the smaller rinks of the NFL. I guess the Sweedish Hockey league has bigger rinks.\n",
      "I wonder how they compare to the rinks in Canada. One of their national sports is hockey, after all.\n",
      "Yeah. The NHL and Canada have some differences too. He may have some issues with Lou Lamoriello of the New York Islanders. He prefers clean cut players.\n",
      "Do you think there's a good reason why?\n",
      "I suppose, but it seems rigid if you ask me.\n",
      "It probably has a lot to do with the culture of a bunch of guys stick checking each other, and not so much helmet safety.\n",
      "Yeah. Well, Jonsson-Fjallby's induction to the big stage during play offs drew U.S. and Canada's attention for sure.\n",
      "He's originally from Sweden, right?\n",
      "Yes. He played for the Swedes and made a game-winning goal to get to the finals. In the end they lost to Canada.\n",
      "Canadian hockey is hardcore. Canada's performed well ever since the start of the modern Olympics back in the 20s.\n",
      "That legendary first olympics when Canada score 132 goals to their opponents three was incredible.\n",
      "Yeah, exactly! I'm not surprised that Canada beat them in the end.\n",
      "Yep. Say, did you hear that there was a hockey player who was traded for only $1 in 1993?\n",
      "Oh really? How'd that work out?\n",
      "The team who traded him had to have been livid when he went on to win four stanely cups. Talk about embarrassing for the trading team.\n",
      "Oh man, $1 for a handful of Stanleys is pretty great. Do you think his hair was long and fabulous like Axel's?\n",
      "He probably had a lot of attitude coming off that type of trade, so I would be surprised. Another crazy fact...hockey players lose up to  8 pounds in one game.\n",
      "Speaking of losing 8 pounds, I probably need to get off the computer and go for a jog or something. Nice chatting with you!\n",
      "You'd probably burn more calories playing hockey. Nice chatting with you too.\n",
      "Hah! Probably so! Thanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi how are you today? do you like sports?\n",
      "Hi.  I am good.  How are you?  I do like sports.  Do you?\n",
      "yes, i dont really know golf and swimming well but they look like interesting activities.\n",
      "Same here.  I've heard that students at Cornell have to pass a basic swimming test before they can graduate.\n",
      "i wonder where that came from. maybe other colleges require the same sort of things, i dunno.\n",
      "I am not sure but it does seem like a good idea.  Interestingly enough, golf requires water as well as swimming.  The average golf course in america uses around 312,000 gallons of water each day.\n",
      "isnt that a waste of water? I figure we need to grow crops with that. hm. \n",
      "It does seem like a large amount going to waste.  Then again, there is a course in Dubai that uses 4,000,000 gallons of water every day.\n",
      "why is there a golf course in the desert? that makes no sense to me. they probably desalinate ocean water too. very expensive.\n",
      "You know, I bet you are right about that. Dubai is for the wealthy so they probably do spend money on that.  Say, did you know that Babe Ruth was not only great at baseball but also at golf?\n",
      "i did not know that. i wonder what led him to playing golf. i guess he was interested in all sports.\n",
      "Maybe so.  Do you like to read?  Have you read any of Mark Twain's works?\n",
      "i love to read. havent read twain in a while. he is great. read him in high school.\n",
      "Me too.  You know he had some highly intelligent friends.  One of which was Nikola Tesla.  The two were reported to be best friends.\n",
      "that is amazing. i didnt think those two would be sympatico because they have such different interests. thats great\n",
      "I know what you mean.  I think because of his writings Twain has always come across as simple and yet there's a lot more to him than in his books come to find out.\n",
      "yeah, he wrote a lot of letters too. made a lot of speeches. great orator.\n",
      "True.  Here's some odd considering all that he has done.  Thomas Edison filmed the only known footage of him.\n",
      "ok, that makes sense. at the time movie cameras were not abundant. i bet there are many photos of him though.\n",
      "Maybe, I would just think that someone other than Edison would film him.  I mean, he's friends with Tesla and Edison is the only person to film him. I find that interesting.\n",
      "i guess edison wanted to show off his invention? twain was a celebrity and would draw attention to the invention too. Anyway, great chat!\n",
      "Oh great point! I never thought of that!\n",
      "everybody wants something. Have a good day!\n",
      "You have a good day as well!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how you are doing today? Have you read any Mark Twain?\n",
      "I am good. How are you?  I have read some Mark Twain.  I read Tom Sawyer a long time ago.\n",
      "I read Huck Finn. Supposed to be the great America novel. Uses the N word a lot. I didn't know that Twain coined the word \"Gullible.\"\n",
      "I didn't either. I was impressed to learn that he and Nikola Tesla were best friends.\n",
      "Tesla was a huge celebrity back in his day. He knew how to play an audience. Many striking photos of Tesla. I wonder what the two of them talked about.\n",
      "I don't know but it's obvious Twain was intelligent.  I mean, Edison had the only known filmed footage of him so Twain must have ran in some pretty smart circles.\n",
      "He was a friend of presidents, artists, and royalty. I guess he always had something to do on a Saturday night. I wonder when he found time to write.\n",
      "I always pictured him as moving slow and sitting around but I guess he was a very busy man.  Who knew Hannibal, Missouri could produce such industrious talent.\n",
      "I guess it was Hannibal's turn. Every town gets a turn, so they've had theirs. I wonder if the US will ever have a talent as prodigious as Twain.\n",
      "I don't know.  Seems like the US is focusing on athletics.  They've won as many gold medals in swimming as the rest of the world combined.\n",
      "That's great, but really, we need the whole country taking care of its health. The obesity epidemic is a catastrophe waiting to happen.\n",
      "Before we can do that we need to change society and laws.  Society needs to be focused on moving around and the laws need to make health care affordable.  Cornell University is moving in the right direction though. They make all of their students pass a basic swimming test before they can graduate. \n",
      "I know that MIT does the same thing. Something about someone drowning that compelled the school to impose a swimming requirement. \n",
      "Well at least the students are getting some exercise.  There are countries that make swimming part of the education curriculum.\n",
      "Swimming is good exercise. Walking is, too. Have you played golf? I never considered it much of a sport, especially compared to swimming.\n",
      "No I never have. It doesn't seem like much of a sport to me either.  \n",
      "I guess it a relaxing way to spend time outdoors, unless you've got money riding on it. It seems a bit expensive for average folk. Plus a huge waste of water.\n",
      "Oh definitely a waste of water!  Dubai has a golf course that uses 4,000,000 gallons of water a day!\n",
      "Dubai is the perfect climate for a golf course! The sport was invented in Scotland, where there's plenty of water. \n",
      "You know i always pictures Scotland having a lot of hills, marshes, and mountains but I guess it makes sense.  Golf has you go through different terrains.\n",
      "In that climate, I guess either you sit around indoors drinking and arguing, or you go on the golf links and argue.\n",
      "I guess so!  Golf takes a long time to play to so you can have a long time to argue.  Back in the day they probably played and dug holes to keep playing until they got a good low score.\n",

      "I am a big fan of tennis.  I even have a tennis shirt that was made by Rene Lacoste.\n",
      "It was made by a tennis player? that is suprising, didnt know that, tennis is a great sport, I love it as well\n",
      "Only one black man has won the US open - is that not crazy?  back in 68\n",
      "That is crazy, I wonder why that happens, have you ever played Nintendo?\n",
      "I have played Nintendo.  It was originally a playing card company!\n",
      "It was? I knew them only because of the gaming system, its a good thing the company has a large cash reserve\n",
      "Yes I used to love their F-zero X game - it had great graphics\n",
      "I didnt play that game I like games like Mario, Zelda and Pokemon, \n",
      "Did you have the handset Nintendo made specifically for Pokemon?\n",
      "No I didnt have that one, it was too expensive well at least for my budget at the time\n",
      "Did you know they even made a Lego knockoff?  I had no idea they did so many things\n",
      "No not really, did you ever played the game Mario Kart? it used to be one of my favorite games\n",
      "Yes I did love that game!    So did lots of other people apparently - its sold over 100 million copies\n",
      "Over 100 million copies! no kidding, that is a lot, speaks a lot about the game\n",
      "Yes it was the best selling racing game of all time!\n",
      "There were 10 huge glitches in the game, I never noticed them though, not even one\n",
      "I never did either.   I live near austin but I have never heard of the place which built a real life Mario Kart\n",
      "That must be nice, I would like to take a picture there, I havent heard of that either, remember the coins and how they made you go faster\n",
      "Yes and most people thought they were random but they were not at all\n",
      "Yeah, did you ever play the Wii version of the game?\n",
      "Yes.   The rapper logic did too - he was really good!\n",
      "He was? I never heard about that, well the wii version had time trials and I liked them, the competivity scene was nice, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you follow tennis?  I do somewhat.\n",
      "I watch it a little.\n",
      "I do when I feel like watching paint dry.  LOL just kidding.  The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days. I know I wouldn't have watched it that long.\n",
      "Me either!  Alot of people really like it though and get all into it.\n",
      "I know I've seen some of those crowds on tv.  Have you ever seen the US open?\n",
      "I think you and I are more Football or basketball fans! I mean come on, who would think grunting before hitting the ball is cheating?\n",
      "Haha right!  They used a helicpoter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US open.  I think it would have made for a better match watching them hit a soggy ball and slipping and sliding. lol\n",
      "Lol, I read that up until 1978 tennis players were allowed to use whatever they wanted as a racket.  What else would you use, a frying pan?\n",
      "LOLOLOL  That would be great!  I would take a baseball bat and smack that ball as far as I could just to make it entertaining for the crowd.  Did you ever have a Nintendo?\n",
      "Sure did and I loved it.  What about you?\n",
      "I did.  I still remember being excited in the late 80s when we got one.  I was surprised to find out that the Nintendo company was founded in 1889 as a playing card company.\n",
      "Yeah, it's hard to believe that it's worth $ 85 Billio.  But, I contributed heavily to that fortune, because I love Donkey Kong, Mario, super Mario, Mario kart, etc. LOL\n",
      "LOL I did too.  I'm pretty sure we've had every Nintendo system that has come out.\n",
      "I made a reference to Mario, yesterday while driving with my daughter.  I told her not to run over a turtle in the road, because it wouldn't be like the turtle shells on Mario and bump out of the way!\n",
      "Lol nice!  If you look on youtube, they have these mario racekart games now where you fly around the track on go karts.  Mario Kart wii is the best selling racing game of all time!\n",
      "I believe it.  All the neighborhood kids gang up at my house to play with my sons. I'll admit, I like to play it just as well as the kids!\n",
      "I like to get competitive with the kids.  I'll be honest though they can really kick my butt. lol  I just read that a Waterloo Labs built a real life Mario Kart at an amusement park in Austin, TX.  So that must be like the race tracks I told you about.\n",
      "I bet it's cool as all get out!  My kids would love it.  Might have to take a road trip to Texas!\n",
      "Did you ever get one o the handsets made for Pokemon?\n",
      "No, did you?\n",
      "I never did but the kids wanted to get one when they came out.  They wanted too much money for them.  I had a good time chatting with you!  I have to get to a meeting soon!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi how are you? do you like video games?\n",
      "I have played my fair share of Nintendo!\n",
      "I played a bit of NES. It was fun. i dont have much time now, unfortunately.\n",
      "Do you know where Nintendo's headquarters is?    I know it is in Japan.\n",
      "There is a headquarters in the US in Washington. \n",
      "I meant the original headquarters.    I heard the company is over 125 years old!\n",
      "The HQ is in Kyoto, or at least it was. the company used to make playing cards. not much money in those, so they made the famicom.\n",
      "Interesting.    I heard they also once made a lego knock-off.\n",
      "yeah, they were trying to figure out what to do to reach the kids market. now they are a world leading video games company.\n",
      "They even own the Seattle Mariners now!    I heard they have 3ds apps for the stadium.\n",
      "That is great! Nintendo has a ton of cash. they could probably buy an NFL franchise too if they wanted too.\n",
      "Perhaps so.    I am a big fan of Mario Kart too.\n",
      "I played that in the arcade. it was a lot of fun. never played it on the home system.\n",
      "They have sold over 100 million copies of that series!\n",
      "Wow. that is great. it was a fun game. lots of characters and power ups. I never got good but it was fun.\n",
      "The rapper logic was a big fan and played against other rappers!\n",
      "He could probably beat me! I enjoyed Mario Kart, but i could never compete professionally LOL\n",
      "Perhaps you should try the real life Mario Kart in Austin, TX!\n",
      "If i show up, I hope they have good insurance! Anyway, great chat!\n",
      "Thanks!     I think I will go play my Pokemon handheld console.\n",
      "Have a good night! Have fun!\n",
      "You too!    Good night!\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi there! How are you tonight? What are you up to?\n",
      "hi how are you? I am just banging out a bunch of chats. You?\n",
      "Just about the same. Are you familiar with Nintendo's Pokemon?\n",
      "Yes, i know a little. I know that there was some game that people played. i never played it.\n",
      "I never played it either, but I know it was popular. Are you familiar with Nintendo at all?\n",
      "I played the NES a little when i was young. I also played the SNES. \n",
      "Yep, me too. I could kind of play anyway. Nintendo is Japan's third most valuable company.\n",
      "Yes, that is a huge company. they have a ton of cash too. they like to make quality games. \n",
      "For sure, but did you know Nintendo is over 100 years old?\n",
      "Yes, they started out by making playing cards. they saw that there was not much future there.\n",
      "Well, they sure switched over to a gold mine. Did you know that Nintendo owns the Seattle Mariners?\n",
      "Yes, that makes sense. Nintendo of america has its headquarters in seattle.\n",
      "Since Nintendo owns the Mariners there;s even a 3DS app that allows you to order food direct to your seat. That would be awesome!\n",
      "That is great. i guess nintendo wants to use its technology whenever it can. i havent played those games in forever. i am totally out of touch.\n",
      "I'm not great at them. I used to play Mario Kart a little. It's the best selling racing game of all time.\n",
      "I think i played the arcade version of that. it was fun. nintendo does game design really well. \n",
      "I agree. The rapper Logic plays Mario Kart. He played different rappers on stage every night for one of his tours. He won every time! 35 in all.\n",
      "I guess that is the new standard of excellence. the video game. I guess i was born too late.\n",
      "I was born too long ago. Well, it was good chatting! Have a good night!\n",
      "You too! Have a good night! Enjoy your nintendo!\n",
      "I will thank you!\n",

      "Do you like listening to rock music?\n",
      "I do!  Do you know that after becoming the biggest rock star in Russian history Viktor Tsoi kept his job in the boiler room of his apartment?\n",
      "wow, that is awesome! Didn't let money get in his way. I know rock has a bunch of music genres that influenced the creation of rock\n",
      "Oh yes!  Blues, rhythm, and blues, and from country music!\n",
      "that is so crazy to think! Have your heard of whitesnake?\n",
      "I have!  They were the first rock concert I ever went to!  \n",
      "no way! small world! I love them. Apparently they have had 50 members throughout its history\n",
      "Wow.  That's a lot. lol  I was surprised to find out recently that \"Do you realize?\" by the Flaming Lips is the state rock song of Oklahoma!\n",
      "I never knew that lol, what an interesting song choice!\n",
      "I didn't even know stats had their own rock songs. lol  Do you remember the band Hanson?\n",
      "I used to love hanson, MMMhbop! I don't know any other songs by them lol\n",
      "lol  Me neither!  One of their songs became a most requested track on Chicago station because the djs didn't reveal who the band was.  lol\n",
      "no way lol! I would have requested that also. Sometimes a good Hanson song helps me get through the day lol. Are you an Elvis fan?\n",
      "I do like him!  Freddie Mercury was also a big fan.\n",
      "Wow, that is a good honor. Didn't he write a song for Elvis?\n",
      "He actually did...he wrote \"Crazy little thing called love\" in only 10 minutes as a tribute to Elvis.\n",
      "wow, I love that song and didn't know it was for Elvis, that is awesome! Did you know Elvis was a blond?\n",
      "Wow.  I had no idea about that.  I always remember him having jet black hair.\n",
      "Right, he used to dye it that color. I don't know if I would have liked a blond Elvis lol. It was great chatting with you!\n",
      "Elvis only failed one class ever and it was music!  How crazy is that!  It\n",
      "wow so crazy, now he showed them why he should have passed! Enjoy your day!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a fan of rock music?\n",
      "I love it!  It is my favorite!\n",
      "Me too!  I grew up right through the 80s and graduated in 89 so it was really popular then.  The state rock song of Oklahoma is \"Do you Realize\" by the Flaming Lips.  I didn't even know that states had their own rock songs. LOL\n",
      "I didnt know that either.  I wonder if Florida has one.  Or if it does do I really want to know?\n",
      "I'm going to have to look that up.  Maybe Walking on Sunshine by Katrina and the Waves. LOL\n",
      "Maybe.  Did you know Whitesnake has had over 50 members in its history?\n",
      "Wow.  I knew they had a lot but didn't know it was that many.  That's funny because Whitesnake was the first big arena rock show I ever went to!\n",
      "That is cool.  One I really want to go to is Dream Theater.  I think they are coming to Florida or at least the Southeast US this year.\n",
      "Nice!  We must be into the same music.  It's been a long time since I've seen them.  I saw them with Queensryche and Fates Warning in the early 2000's.  Did you know that a Hanson song became a most requested song on a Chicago state because the djs didn't reveal the name of the band.  That's funny.\n",
      "Awesome!  It is odd, I guess it was a good song if people kept requesting it.\n",
      "Yes.  Did you ever get into Elvis?  The older I get the more I like him for some reason.\n",
      "I never cared too much for him.  He failed music class.  How was that possible.\n",
      "lol  I never knew that.  He was naturally blonde and dyed his hair black.  I never knew that either.\n",
      "I always thought his hair was naturally black.  I wonder what prompted him to dye it?\n",
      "I don't know.  That's the first time I've ever heard that about him.  lol  Kurt Russell was in Forrest Gump.  He did the voice of Elvis.  I'm learning all kinds of things.  lol\n",
      "Same here.  Freddie Mercury wrote Crazy little thing called love in 10 minutes as a tribute to him. \n",
      "That I've heard before.  I also knew that his daughter Lisa Marie was married to both Michael Jackson and Nicholas Cage.\n",
      "I knew she was married to Jackson, but not Cage.\n",
      "I just remember it because it was all over the tabloids in the grocery store aisles. lol  Do you still use libraries?  I do, but not as much as I used to.\n",
      "I dont as much as I should.  I end up buying a  lot of books.\n",
      "If I had the money, I would buy a lot more books.  I used them alot in the 90s and early 2000s.  Used to get a ton of books, cds, and dvds to save money.  There are more libraries in the US than there are Mcdonalds.\n",
      "Most adults even have library cards!\n",
      "That's a good thing I think.  I always have told people to use the libraries to save money.  I have to get going and eat dinner.  I loved the chat!\n",
      "It was great!  Enjoy dinner!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a fan of rock music?\n",
      "Very much so. I especially like the grunge era. How about you?\n",
      "I like it all!  lol  I grew up in the 70s and 80s so I got a good dose of everything and grunge came into style when I was in college.  Do you remember Hanson?  They had a most requested song on a Chicago alt-rock radio station because the djs didn't reveal the name of the band.  funny!\n",
      "I vaguely remember Hanson. The idea of a rock history class sounds really cool to me. A lesson including both Elvis and Bill Monroe would be amazing!\n",
      "Yes it would!  We can work Elvis in to the rock talk. lol  He was naturally blonde and he dyed his hair black!\n",
      "I literally had no inkling about that until now.\n",
      "I didn't either.  Did you know that Elvis' daughter Lisa was married to both Michael Jackson and Nicholas Cage?\n",
      "I knew she was married to Jackson, but not to Cage. Do you like the Progressive Rock era?\n",
      "I do!  Ask me anything lol  The state rock song of Oklahoma is \"do you realize\" by the Flaming Lips.\n",
      "I should google that just to see how bad it is. I think the provincial song of Alberta should be \"Rodeo Song\" LOL.\n",
      "LOL  You're way up there then eh? lol  Whitesnake has had over 50 members throughout its history.  Crazy!\n",
      "Nah, I'm not actually in Alberta, I'm in Arkansas. I just think that's a funny song LOL. Yeah, Whitesnake sounds like it could be about ten Whitesnake tribute bands.\n",
      "lol  Elvis only ever failed one class...ironically it was music!\n",
      "Sometimes people who fail subjects in school wind up being the most creative people in those fields. Are you an Elvis fan?\n",
      "I am a big fan!  I like his earlier stuff.  Kurt Russell was the voice of Elvis in Forrest Gump!\n",
      "Yeah, I like his earlier stuff too -- back when he was a rockabilly pioneer. He was just a glorified lounge singer in the 60s IMO.\n",
      "YES!  That was my favorite era of his!  Love, love the rockabilly stuff and he lost me as the lounge singer.  lol  Freddie Mercury of Queen wrote \"crazy little thing called love\" as a tribute to Elvis.\n",
      "I was in high school when that came out. I remember sitting in my friend's muscle car in the morning before class drinking Southern Comfort while it played on the radio, LOL.\n",
      "Nice!  I miss muscle cars.  I wonder how many copies of Elvis' cds are at my local library?  I might have to go check that out.  It's been fun chatting!\n",
      "My library has a good CD selection too. Nice chatting with you as well!\n",
      "Have a great day!  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Do you like Elvis Presley ? \n",
      "Yes, he was a little before my time, but I remember him in movies also.\n",
      "I know he is important, he widened the musical interest of a lot of people. But I just don't listen to him \n",
      "Me either, I think it's cool that Freddie Mercury of the band Queen, wrote the song, Crazy little thing called love, in 10 minutes as a tribute to Presley.\n",
      "I think Rock music important historically, but is less relevant today. I don'T think Van Zandt initiative to teahc kid about american history through rock music will succeed. \n",
      "I agree with that also, It's funny to see the one class Presley failed was his music class?\n",
      "It is funny, but at the same time, maybe it shows that that when Elvis was a kid, music was boring.\n",
      "True, I see that he was also a natural blonde, I thought it looked like he had dyed black hair.\n",
      "that is surprising, today no one who is naturally blonde would dye his hair black.\n",
      "Lisa Marie Presley, his daughter married both Michael Jackson and Nicolas Cage\n",
      "I don't she would have met them if her father was not as popular. \n",
      "I agree, Did you know there's is more libraries than McDonalds in the U.S.?\n",
      "Well, that is encouraging for the country. I wonder if people use them for book, or other medias like DVDs. \n",
      "I'm curious about that as well, I see that in Sacramento CA, they have a \"Library of Things\" where you can check out sewing machines, and other things like that, that's a good idea as long as people return them.\n",
      "People are responsible, most of the time. I think it is a great idea, I don't need to have tools all the time, only once or twice a year.\n",
      "True, over 50% of Americans have a library card still, that's encouraging. \n",
      "Yeah, do you go often to your library ?\n",
      "I just took my mother last week, to our local library, it's a huge library that does a lot for the Senior Community also.\n",
      "What kind of book do you read ? A prisoner studied law in a prison library to prove his innocence. \n",
      "I like Mysteries and True Crime, Auto Biographies.  How about you?\n",
      "I like 18th century fiction, like Dickens and Balzac. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi how are U? do you like star wars?\n",
      "I do like Star Wars. How about yourself?\n",
      "Star Wars was a seminal event in my life. changed my view of film. loved it. didnt have money but to see it twice. \n",
      "Oh, I absolutely agree. Did you know that George Lucas' back then wife had a major impact on the original Star Wars?\n",
      "he was really lucky to have met a partner with such a talent for story. she won an oscar too.\n",
      "Incredible. I guess 20th Century Fox believed that Star Wars would be a flop, too!\n",
      "yeah, the execs have no imagination. it was an strange film for the time, no one knew what was to come.\n",
      "It is a very strange film. All fantasy films are, though.\n",
      "it is fantasy, you're right. not science fiction. space fantasy. lots of religion and mysticism.\n",
      "Are you a fan of other fantasy films, by any chance?\n",
      "i did like the LOTR series. i think it was hard to realize the books on the screen. many fans want it to follow the books. that doesnt work.\n",
      "Apparently, 101 Dalmatians is on the borderline of a fantasy film. Surprising!\n",
      "101 dogs all together? i can imagine! i have not seen that film in forever.\n",
      "Me neither! I guess Jim Henson also created some fantasy stuff as well.\n",
      "he did dark crystal, i think? i dont remember. very creative guy.\n",
      "Yes, exactly! He wanted to return the fantasy genre to its darker roots when he created it.\n",
      "yes, the dark scary part is important. the stories explore our fears in an unreal space. that is important for children. fear is part of life.\n",
      "Oh, yes. I agree. Do you watch Game of Thrones? I feel like that could be considered a fantasy genre as well.\n",
      "Yes, and this year is the last season. man  i am looking forward to it. Anyway, great chat!\n",
      "Great chatting with you as well. If you have any suggestions for fantasy films, let me know.\n",
      "Have you seen the Princess Bride? a comedy classic. Have a great day!\n",
      "You as well.\n",
      "Thanks!\n",
      "Bye!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Fantasy films are one of my favorite genres - do you like them?\n",
      "I'm not too into them. Do you like Lord of the Rings? I thought it was good.\n",
      "I did - it even won Best Picture it was so good\n",
      "Yeah that is the first and only fantasy film to have done that\n",
      "I was surprised to see Jim Henson created a dark film called the dark crystal - he always seemed so upbeat.\n",
      "Yeah I guess he thought that it was unhealthy for kids never to be scared. I noticed a little bit of darkness in a sesame street youtube clip my kids were watching today. They asked for it to be turned off. It's Bert and Ernie in a pyramid.\n",
      "I have never seen that one.  Have you ever been to a fan convention?  They can be pretty crazy and lucrative for the stars\n",
      "No I haven't. How much can stars make?\n",
      "Some make more than 100,000 per weekend!\n",
      "Wow, pretty cool. Seems like it would be good to break up the routine as well.\n",
      "Yep.  Though the movies can be time-consuming - the thief and the cobbler that took 31 years to make!\n",
      "Wow, how interesting. I wonder how that works since technology must have advanced a lot in those years\n",
      "At least it was animated and not made with real actors!\n",
      "Right, I had the same thought! I still wondered though how they pieced together animation from different times.\n",
      "I am not sure.  Game of Thrones is about to come on - have you seen it?  Its a great fantasy show\n",
      "I have seen it but it didn't hold my attention. Arya is a pretty name. I guess it's from Game of Thrones?\n",
      "Yes and its really popular as a baby name now!\n",
      "Yeah, I heard it's the fastest rising new baby name!\n",
      "Ireland even finances the series because it boosts tourism\n",
      "How interesting! Have you watched Game of Lions? Maybe that would interest me more because it is about the lives of lions.\n",
      "I have never heard of it.  I know Charlie Chaplins granddaughter is in Game of Thrones\n",
      "And Harry Lloyd is the great great great grandson of Charles Dickens!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi Do you like to watch fantasy films?\n",
      "I love fantasy films and books, probably my favorite things to read or watch.\n",
      "Nice!  I loved Lord of the Rings and currently love Game of Thrones.\n",
      "Yep I read all of lord of the rings after watching the movies, read the song of ice series before game of thrones started on tv, wish GRRM would finish book six already, but man the show is amazing.\n",
      "Yes it is!  Harry Lloyd who played Viserys Targaryen is the great great great grandson of Charles Dickens.\n",
      "have you seen \n",
      "Hmmm.....I'm not sure what you were trying to ask\n",
      "Yeah sorry about that , I accidentally hit enter in the middle of typing. I was asking if you had seen westworld, its really good to. \n",
      "I have seen that.  I like that one alot too!  I was just looking and I see there is another famous connection in GOT.  Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter is in it.  I never knew those fact.\n",
      "The singer Ed Sheeran was in an episode of game of thrones also, he was with a group of guys sitting around a fire singing in season 7.\n",
      "I do remember reading that somewhere.  There is a National Geographic wild show called Game of Lions that follows the lives of lions just like the GOT characters.  lol\n",
      "I have seen that show a few times it is actually pretty good, you wouldn't think a show just following lions would work but it is actually really interesting.\n",
      "I'm going to have to watch it to see it.  I'm intrigued.  GOT gets financed by Ireland because they film scenes there which boosts tourism incomes.\n",
      "I t one of the most expensive shows on television so that is pretty crazy that Ireland pays for it, but then again it also makes a ton of money, people subscribe to HBO for that show alone. \n",
      "I work with people who can get enough of it.  Were you ever a Star Wars fan?\n",
      "I love the original 3, the prequels were not as bad as people let on, and the newer ones are kind of meh in my opinion, The force awakens was really good but the last Jedi was terrible, mainly because I hated how they did Luke Skywalkers death.\n",
      "I would have to see I agree with you on all points.  I wonder if Luke really died though?  Be curious to see how they wrap up it all up in the last episode.  The entire franchise had done over $8.5 billion dollars at the box office!\n",
      "Oh yeah they make money hand over fist, but i have a feeling a lot of that is due to nostalgia from older generations who loved the originals.\n",
      "Yes.  The entire franchise is valued at $65 billion if you include everything else besides just the movies.  \n",
      "Yeah but it is sad that it is valued so high yet the guy who did the voice of Chewbaca, Peter Mayhew, made almost nothing for voicing the character and got none of the royalties from the originals either. He got pretty screwed in the long run.\n",
      "I didn't know that. Yikes.  I had fun chatting with you today!  Hope the rest of your day is great!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey there what do you think about the Star Wars franchise? I personally like the first three but don't like the rest of them\n",
      "I love all of them. I love all of those super hero, sci-fi type of movies like Solo and Deadpool.\n",
      "Yes I like the Deadpool movie more than the new Star Wars movies personally. I think that Lucas was a genius though. He gave up some of his directing fee to get the licensing for the first movie, and then became a billionaire after that\n",
      "Wow, that's incredible. Guess it paid off for him! Unlock Al Pacino, who actually turned down the role for Han Solo. I guess his career still took off, but still.\n",
      "Yeah he still did fine haha. But I wonder how different Star Wars would have been if he were chosen instead. I also think it's interesting that Star Wars has been dubbed into Navajo. Definitely not a major language but an interesting one nonetheless\n",
      "That's definitely cool! Evidently Christopher Walken was considered for the role of Han Solo, as well!\n",
      "Wow now that would be really different LOL, do you know that George Lucas's wife at the time, Marcia Lucas, was actually responsible for a lot of things that made the original Star Wars film good? Things like Obi-Wan's death and Leia's good luck kiss. She also re-edited the Trench Run of the Death Star. I don't think the movie would have been the same without her, but you never hear about her\n",
      "That's crazy. At least the guy who played Poe in The Force Awakens was able to shed light on Guatemela, since he was from there. Evidently, he insisted to be from Yavin 4 because that's where those scenes were filmed.\n",
      "Yeah that's nice that they were able to help him out by making his character be from that planet. It's very strange to that George Lucas wanted Han Solo to be either a large green alien or a black man, and then we ended up with Harrison Ford LOL\n",
      "And it's funny thinking about the companionship he had with Chewbacco later in life, if that had actually been a large green alien. Like Jaba the Hut??\n",
      "Haha that's a good question. It's also interesting that Han Solo was a TIE fighter before he started to fly the Millennium Falcon. We didn't get to see that in the original movies, but I haven't seen solo, so maybe that's where it started?\n",
      "Yeah, you get to see a lot of his origin story in Solo. He also worked as an Imperial Lieutenant.\n",
      "Yep that's true. Did you say that you liked Deadpool by the way? I like the first movie more than the second, what about you?\n",
      "I definitely liked the first one better. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for the part, which I suppose the creator Deadpool thought, too. He was described as \"Ryan Reynolds crossed with a shar-pei.\"\n",
      "Haha that's awesome! I'm glad that they were able to get him to play the role because that's so funny that it was in the comic like that. I also think it's interesting that the voice of the mystery villain is Ryan Reynolds too, in Deadpool 2, do you remember who the mystery voice was?\n",
      "Yeah, the screenwriters said it was also Ryan Reynolds. It really is great. It's the highest grossing r-rated movie of all time!\n",
      "Did you ever play the Deadpool video game? Apparently it cost more than the movie itself. I played the game and I actually liked it a lot, just like the movie in terms of the humor and violence\n",
      "No, I didn't. I didn't even know there was one, to be honest! I wonder if there will be a Deadpool 3\n",
      "I think there will be. I know that they're building up to it. So as long as they have a good script they will probably do it. Do you know who James Cameron and David Fincher are? They're both very famous directors and they helped to get the original Deadpool movie made in the first place\n",
      "Yeah, they're both friends with Tim Miller, who only directed the first one. He left early in during the Deadpool 2 project due to creative differences.\n",
      "Yeah that's interesting. I wonder how the second one would have been, if it would have been better or worse, with the original director. I don't know why they got rid of him though. I would have liked to know the exact issue that they had\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi! Are you a Star Wars fan?\n",
      "Hello there, yeah I am, how about you?\n",
      "I'm impartial, but I admire the creator George Lucas for his boldness and creativity to think outside the box and create a successful empire.\n",
      "Yeah I agree, he created a whole following that is pretty intense these days!\n",
      "Yeah and to think that film studios back then were convinced that the movie was going to flop thereby agreeing to a deal to forgo $500K in directing fees so that he can keep licensing and merchandising rights for himself. Genius!\n",
      "Yeah what a good move, who would have thought how much the franchise would be worth today. \n",
      "They do offer the film in numerous languages worldwide but only recently did they dub it in Navajo for Native American's, I would think that they understood English?\n",
      "Yeah same here, but that is really cool that they would do that.  Do you know how long it took James Earl Jones to record darth vaders lines for the first film?\n",
      "No I'm not sure how long, but if I had to take a guess I would say one year? Am I close?\n",
      "No, I guess it was only two and a half hours!  He got paid $7500, but that was good money for under three hours of work!\n",
      "oh my goodness! That is a great paycheck while others are making minimum wage! He probably also got payment as a result of license and merchandise deals too probably, except no one knows who the actor is or that he was in the film\n",
      "Yeah right, good money for the time as well.  Did you know Al Pacino turned down the role of Han Solo?\n",
      "I wonder if AL Pacino regrets that decision. To not be casted after auditioning is one story, but to turn down an offer that's insane! I think I'm more of a Deadpool fan than Star Wars.\n",
      "Yeah I bet, did you see the newest Deadpool movie that came out?\n",
      "Of course! I really enjoy his sarcastic sense of humor but others don't get it. The video game actually cost more money to make than the movie. I don't play video games but that's insane!\n",
      "Wow, that is incredible!  And yeah I like how a superhero movie can be rated R and be fun!\n",
      "Seriously! I think Ryan Reynolds did a great job, he's also the voice of the mystery villain!\n",
      "I never knew that!  Yeah he is a great actor and I think he is a really good person in real life as well. \n",
      "I agree! He's hilarious in real life because I enjoy his interviews on talk shows. They did a great job of casting all the Marvel characters\n",
      "Yeah they really did, I think most of all of the people they got are perfect for their roles. \n",
      "I agree! Even the directors! James Cameron and David Fincher actually convinced Deadpool's director to direct the film, I wonder why they didn't do it themselves.\n",
      "Yeah that is a good question.  Well it was nice taking with you today, I hope you have a good day. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "Hello there, I am well thank you.  Are you a fan of Star Wars?\n",
      "I am. I love star wars but I am not a nut that knows all of the characters.\n",
      "Yeah there are some true Star Wars nuts out there, I enjoy the movies as well but not that nuts. What is your favorite of the films?\n",
      "I like Star Wars. The second one, according to the release date. You?\n",
      "Yeah same here, The Empire Strikes Back was the best of the bunch.  They can't replicate that again. \n",
      "No. I thought Jar Jar Binx killed the next series of 3. Now I am worried they will be overexposed with all the movies and that will kill them.\n",
      "Yeah he was really bad, I didn't like when they re-did the music scene in Return of the Jedi as well. \n",
      "Yeah... Do you like the new ones that came out? I thought Solo was average. I expected more out of them...\n",
      "I haven't seen the Solo one or the Last Jedi, but I really want to, I just have been so busy and didn't make it to the theaters. \n",
      "Both are now out on Netflix. I watched Solo in two parts. Haven't seen the last Jedi. I am like you and too busy for theaters...\n",
      "Yeah I liked the look of Solo from the previews, but I want to see both equally I would say. \n",
      "Solo was OK. I have a hard time gauging the quality of it since it got bad reviews. I thought it was ok but lacked some meat.\n",
      "Yeah and plus if you are a fan of the original ones before the 90's then all of them are hard to say they are good.  \n",
      "Maybe that's the issue... I am comparing them to the originals, which are almost perfect.\n",
      "Yeah that is how I feel I am too, because they are that good where it is just impossible to replicate. \n",
      "I am surprised that Star Wars was the first movie to be dubbed in Navajo and was the first major film to be dubbed in Native American. Seems like it should have been done before 2013…\n",
      "Yeah I am the same way, it took way too long, but I guess later is better than never. \n",
      "Yeah. If you're al pacino, do you regret turning down the role of al pacino?\n",
      "Right, think about how iconic that role has become.  But when I think about it, Pacino has no problem with that. \n",
      "True. Nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi, do you watch star wars?\n",
      "I love watching Star Wars, but I haven't had a chance to see the new Han Solo movie yet. I heard it was a nice addition to the saga\n",
      "Yeah it was for sure. do you know who Oscar Isaac is?\n",
      "Is he a character in the movie? I don't remember that name\n",
      "Yeah he played the role of poe dameron and requested that the character be a native of yavin 4\n",
      "Interesting. Without Star Wars, the director James Cameron would have never quit his job as a truck driver\n",
      "Good for him. Yeah that was because he is originally from guatemala and that is where the scenes were filmed\n",
      "That makes sense. The whole saga as we know it is actually told by R2D2 centuries after it all occurs\n",
      "Yeah. James Earl Jones was only paid $7500 for his reading of lines for 2.5 hours\n",
      "He must have really believed in the project. Can you imagine if Bill Murray had gotten the role of Han Solo instead? It would feel like a completely different character\n",
      "For sure. George Lucas' wife was also very involved in the scripts for the movie\n",
      "That's awesome! That must have taken them a while. In the original, Han Solo was supposed to be secretly married to a Wookie. I'm sure someone has written fan fiction about that\n",
      "Yeah I bet too. Yeah his wife made some awesome changes and actually won the academy award for it\n",
      "Maybe she's the one responsible for the Han Solo and Leia romance. The movies now hold the record for the most successful merchandising franchise\n",
      "yes she is I think. And it is the first major movie dubbed in Navajo\n",
      "In the mix of its accomplishments, it's the second highest grossing film series of all time\n",
      "that is amazing. did you ever watch deadpool?\n",
      "No, I didn't. He's one character of the Marvel Comics whom I don't have much interest in. Which is confusing since the rights are owned by Fox\n",
      "I see. apparently deadpool describes himself as 'ryan reynolds crossed with a sharpei'\n",
      "That's an interesting mix of characters. It took Ryan Reynolds 11 years to get the movie made\n",
      "Yeah , he believed he was destined for the role. nice chat\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello. Have you seen the panda researchers? They are so cute in their panda costumes.\n",
      "I have not seen them, I probably assumed that they were pandas too, they must have bee realistic.\n",
      "They are adorable, and always make me smile. Same with Johnny Depp, traveling with his Jack Sparrow costume, so he can visit sick kids.\n",
      "I'm not sure how I'd feel about an impromptu visit from a pirate if I were in hospital.  At least it's not Willy Wonka, he was kind of creepy.\n",
      "That, he was. I like him in the Captain Jack role, so I would be thrilled to see him.\n",
      "So he hauls that costume around wherever he goes, I wonder if he has a make-up artist in tow to do his face too.\n",
      "He's been in Hollywood long enough to know how to put on eyeliner, lol.\n",
      "I understand art, literature, music and painting were in the Olympics, I wonder if make-up artistry was ever in it too\n",
      "I don't know. Winston Churchill won a nobel prize for literature, he could have been in the Olympics.\n",
      "I'm surprised he had times for everything, I know he painted too.  He could have been a multi gold winner like Michael Phelps.\n",
      "He also read a book a day. Do you know when it was , the FDA burned six tons of literature?\n",
      "I would hazard a guess in the fifties, but it just a guess.  There are always moral panics about whatever the kids are into these days.  I wonder how many books six tons represents.\n",
      "That's a good question. It's fascinating that romantic kissing is rarely mentioned in ancient greek literature, they invented debauchery.\n",
      "See, not everything was better in the old days.  The debauchery probably came from wearing those togas.\n",
      "Those would be better than the costumes they wore in Gone with the Wind, or even the costume her cousin (Doc Holiday) wore in the old west.\n",
      "Good or bad costumes, the movie was a smash, I believe when inflation adjusted it is still the biggest movie of all time.\n",
      "It's interesting her parents didn't tell her the south lost, until she was ten.'\n",
      "It was probably a more sheltered time, plus not the kind of thing you bring up often if you live in the south.  \n",
      "I would have loved to have been at the festival when Gone with the Wind was released.\n",
      "Perfect time to get dressed up in authentic costume, or have Leo Tally whip something up for you.\n",
      "Thank you for chatting with me, I have to get the kids ready for bed. Have a wonderful night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "do you like literature?\n",
      "I love it. Did you know the FDA once burned tons of books?\n",
      "Yes that was during censorship and it was 6 tons, crazy\n",
      "Yea. There is a contest every year for the novel with the worst opening sentence\n",
      "Yeah must be a fun one. Did you know Churchil won a nobel prize in literature?\n",
      "Yes that was back in 1953, pretty talented guy\n",
      "I know right? Literature was also part of the Olympic Games\n",
      "Yeah until 1952 along with music, painting and sculpture\n",
      "Yeah. Did you know romantic kissing is hard to find in ancient iterature?\n",
      "Yes it is quite the new development in literture\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes that is why you cannot find it in the works in ancient Greek.\n",
      "Yeah. Did you know panda researchers wear panda costumes?\n",
      "Yes pretty cool.. Did you know Sean Bean is scared of flying and once hiked a mountain in costume for recordings\n",
      "Yes that was actually for the filming of LOrd of the RIngs. \n",
      "Yeah. Did you know Johnny Depp wears the Jack Sparrow costume and visits kids in the hopsital?\n",
      "Yes that is so nice of him to take the time to do that for them\n",
      "Yes it sure is. THe hoggle costume got lost in shipping, from the movie Labyrinth \n",
      "Yes so not it is in the unclaimed baggage museum in Alabama\n",
      "Yeah nice. Have you seen the movie Gone with the Wind?\n",
      "I have read the novel but not the movie and you?\n",
      "Yes both. Do you know what year the novel came out?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "Hey, i am good!  Do you know who Nelson Mandela is?\n",
      "I do know who he is. Do you know who he is?\n",
      "Yes i do... Interesting, there would be a documentary about his fashion!\n",
      "I know. Seems really acute for a documentary...\n",
      "I love how Talley says it is a moral code to dress well... something this genration should take into consideration!\n",
      "Yeah. I supervise young staff and cannot believe what I see them wear, more like what i do not see them wear.\n",
      "LOL... yeah, that's for sure... really just comes down to one thing... respect!  if you wear disrespectful clothes, then you show no respect for the people around you.  Especially in a work environment!\n",
      "Yeah! The FDA would burn their clothes like 6 tons of literature!\n",
      "LOL... for sure!  I wonder why the FDA would have anything to do with literature though?\n",
      "I am not sure. Churchill won a nobel prize in literature!\n",
      "I can see that... who was a brilliant man!  That's funny how romantic kissing in literature is a modern development.\n",
      "It's like my life... wasn't there until recently... Did you know literature was an olympic event from 1912-1952? Seems so different!\n",
      "Yeah i saw that, imagine watching someone designing a building on ABC?  LOL\n",
      "HA! \"Such great lines\" impecibly built! POst moderism at it's finest... I can hear the snooty!\n",
      "Hahahaa!!! Yeah... been commentated by Joe Buck!\n",
      "You could not pick a better commentator. Nicely done!\n",
      "Why thank ya!  You should become a panda researcher so you get to were a panda costume to work!  LOL\n",
      "I should have thought about that. That would make wearing the costume a lot less awkward than it is right now.\n",
      "That's awesome how Johnny Depp makes surprise visits to sick kids in hospitals!\n",
      "Yeah. Nice of him. Nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hey there, do you like literature?\n",
      "I love to read, so yeah. That is why it makes me mad when I found out that the FDA burned 6 tons of literature in order to censor.\n",
      "I know so sad. there is a competition where the person that writes the worst opening sentence for a novel wins\n",
      "I have heard about that. Did you know that Sir Winston Churchill won a nobel prize in lit, not peace! \n",
      "The guy was so smart , got his hands on everything really.\n",
      "I know! Amazing. Have you ever read Gone with the Wind? It is great.\n",
      "Yes I loved that book, read it in university. Literature was even an Olympic event.\n",
      "It was written by Margaret Mitchell. I love books that are based out of the south. Scarlett is one of my all time favorite characters.\n",
      "She could have won the olympic medal for that work of literature. did you know kissing was not even mentioned in ancient greek literature?\n",
      "No way! I can't believe how many tickets have been sold for the movie. Supposedly it sold 220 million and the population at that time was only 131 million. \n",
      "that really does not make sense, strange, maybe people who were visiting bought tickets too\n",
      "Or people saw the movie numerous times. If you adjust for inflation it would be the highest grossing film of all time.\n",
      "yeah that makes sense. the mayor of atlanta even declared a 3-day festival when the movie was released\n",
      "That is cool. You know that it is the second favorite book of American readers, behind the Bible!  That is crazy to think about that.\n",
      "I know, what a reach. did you know that panda researchers wear panda costumes?\n",
      "What? Well Johnny Depp brings his Jack Sparrow costume with him when he travels. That way he can visit sick kids in the hospital and surprise them. \n",
      "That is so nice since so many kids like that character. I heard he does this because once his daughter was really sick and the hospital managed to save her.\n",
      "Wow. I didn't know that. I love costumes from movies. The hoggle costume from labyrinth was lost in shipping and now is at the unclaimed baggage museum in Alabama. Seems like they would have just returned it.\n",
      "You would think so. I guess more people get to see it since it is in a musem now. \n",
      "That's true. I think it is funny that they used to call a swim suit a swimming costume! So weird.\n",
      "I know, how things have changed. It was nice chatting with you\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hey there, do you watch tennis?\n",
      "Yes, I like tennis especially when Serena Williams is playing.\n",
      "did you know that a tennis player was how polo shirts came about?\n",
      "No, I didn't know, I was thinking It was because of the polo players.\n",
      "apparently it was because of rene lacoste\n",
      "Oh, no black man won the tennis title since 1968?\n",
      "that is strange. apparently in the us open 1969 it rained so much they used a helicopter to dry it\n",
      "Yes it is, I wonder just how they went about drying a field with a helicopter? \n",
      "it must have been the propeller mocing so fast that removed the water drops\n",
      "Yes, can you imaging a tennis match last 11 hours spread over 3 days? That's almost 4 hours a day.\n",
      "the players must have been exhausted by the end of it\n",
      "Do you remember Billie Jean King? she was also a good tennis player.\n",
      "No I do not. Do you watch all the games that Serena plays?\n",
      "Yes almost all her games, I like her sister also, but I like Serena has a little more arm strength than she does.\n",
      "and they are both so smart and speak fluent french and italian\n",
      "That I didn't know, I didn't know they both speak 3 languages.\n",
      "and serena is even a co-owner of miami dolphins\n",
      "Yes, I was surprised to hear that, I thought her mind would be closely focused on tennis. \n",
      "yeah , she is all over the place. she won the 23rd grand slam while pregnant\n",
      "I was also surprised she played while being pregnant. I am proud she didn't let anything stop her. \n",
      "I know and that baby was born a champion. it was nice chatting with you\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you know that the highest point on the moon is 1938 meters higher than mount everest?\n",
      "No, I always think of it as flat and crater filled. It's the fifth largest natural satellite in the Solar System.\n",
      "I didn't know it.   I did know that on Titan, which is a moon of Saturn, there is some evidence of methane based life.\n",
      "That's fascinating, imagine if they finally find definitive proof of life somewhere. \n",
      "That would be cool.  By the way are you a movie fan?\n",
      "I am. I always like Leonardo DiCaprio, didn't realize he was so old, born in 1974.\n",
      "Just a few years older than me.  Tom Hanks is the highest all time box-office star!!\n",
      "Just a little older than me too, but I'll pretend he's much older.  Tom Hanks has certainly made some memorable films, but to be the highest box office earner is crazy.\n",
      "I know, he has over $8.5 billion in worldwide film earnings.\n",
      "That's can't even imagine money.  I don't think of the Silence of the Lambs as a date movie but it premiered on Valentine's Day in 1991. \n",
      "I don't think of it as a date movie either.  Disney is killing it now with it's Marvel movies, etc. but a while back, Treasure Planet was one of the most expensive flops of all time.\n",
      "Disney actually considered shutting down their animation studio after Sleeping Beauty was a box office failure.  I can't imagine my childhood without Disney animated movies.\n",
      "I can't either. Hey, you mentioned Leonardo DiCaprio earlier.  Did you know Growing Pains helped launch his career?\n",
      "I did, Growing Pains helped a few actors in their career, namely Brad Pitt and Matthew Perry. \n",
      "I knew that as well.  Dicaprio is producing a new Twilight Zone movie.\n",
      "I'm interested to see where that goes.  I wonder if he'll win any awards for it, sad he's only won a Golden Globe. \n",
      "That is crazy, I figured he had many awards.  \n",
      "He did have Marlon Brando's oscar, but he had to turn it over to the US government.\n",
      "I wonder why that was?  I know he starred in \"The Revenant\" but I never saw it.\n",
      "Me either, it's a remake of the 1971 film, Man in the Wilderness,  Never saw that either!\n",
      "well,thanks for the chat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good morning!  Do you watch tennis?  I recently learned that the longest tennis match in history lasted for three days.\n",
      "I dont usually watch it, no. I do like playing though. its too hard to follow for me\n",
      "I agree that it can be hard to follow.  It reminds me of another game that is hard to follow.  Say, did you know that polo shirts were actually invented by a tennis player for tennis?\n",
      "really? thats fun. Im a fan of polo shits but i would have assumed they were invented for, well, Polo!\n",
      "Me too.  It just makes sense.  They were invented by a player, rene lacoste, for tennis.  Over time they were adopted by polo players.\n",
      "hey I knew Lacoste! The alligator shirts!\n",
      "Right!  Those shirts became really popular for everybody and still are.  Speaking of popular, have you heard of Serena Williams?  She's one of the top ranked female tennis players.\n",
      "yea I know her! Shes younger than i thought.,. born in 1981. Shes a superstar. she co owns the Miami Dolphins too!\n",
      "Does she really?  i guess i just thought of her as a tennis player.  It's cool to know that she owns a business, especially a football team.\n",
      "I feel like so many sports stars start to go into business once they have wayyyyy too much money\n",
      "I know what you mean.  Serena is surprising though.  She's not only great at tennis but speaks french and itialian.\n",
      "So is her sister! I wonder why\n",
      "I don't know but it is impressive.  Maybe she is an overachiever.  She won a grand slam tournament while she was pregnant after all.\n",
      "I'm shocked they let her play! \n",
      "I was surprised too. I would have thought it would be dangerous for the baby but she played and didn't drop a single set.\n",
      "apparently in 2007 she was ranked 95th in the world. Is that high? im not really sure. i wouldve expected it to be higher i guess\n",
      "I don't know. With everything reported about her it does seem low.  She's a very confident woman though. She said she could beat any man ranked 200 or worse in tennis and a man took up the challenge and beat her.\n",
      "thats awkward haha her hubris got the best of her in that situation I guess\n",
      "I guess so.  She has reached a ranking of number one before so maybe that gave her the encouragement.\n",
      "I hope so because she really is one of the greats. Shes even beaten Maria Sharapova\n",
      "I think the only women ranked above her in some ranking is Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How's it going? Did you know Polo shirts were originally invented for a tennis player?\n",
      "Noway, really? That is cool. I really like to watch Serena Williams. She is so talented and unstoppable. \n",
      "Yea, Serena Williams has been ranked Number 1 eight times by the WTA\n",
      "Is that right, wow! She is superwoman. I recently heard that she is part co owner of the Miami Dolphins! I had no idea.\n",
      "Yea Williams is a pretty good player, she kept one of her No. 1 rankings for 186 weeks straight\n",
      "Wow, good for her! I know that some people consider grunting before a shot to be cheating but I don't know about that? I guess some people think its a form of cheating more or less.\n",
      "It does sound annoying, but not as annoying as a helicopter being use to dry the grass on a tennis court like in the 1969 US open \n",
      "Yeah, it does sound gross, I agree. I get used to it after a while. Serena went pro when she was only 13 years old. Another amazing fun fact.\n",
      "I wonder what her longest match was and if it game close the the longest match in tennis history at 11 hours\n",
      "Wow, that's a marathon!! What the heck. I heard that the longest rally was 643 shots, I think.\n",
      "That's pretty crazy. The first US open was won in 1968 by the only black man to ever win the open\n",
      "Wow, again. That is something else. 1968 was a long time ago. The longest rally went 29 mins too , i think.\n",
      "Tennis player Gael Monfils beat one of the best paddle tennis players days after learning just how to play\n",
      "Gosh, I wish I could play any sport. I heard ping pong wasn't even called ping pong but I am not very good at that one anyways. I guess its called table tennis officially. It is fun to play sometimes though.\n",
      "Yea if your ok at it. Did you know Serena Williams won her 23rd grand slam when she was 2 months pregnant?\n",
      "Noway, I was hugging something at 2 months and it wasn't a racket. That is crazy! It reminds me of a Katy Perry song.\n",
      "Which one? Not one of her debut songs on the album Katy Hudson?\n",
      "It was the Hear me Roar song, not sure which album though.\n",
      "It's crazy Russel Brand ended his marriage with Perry over a text message\n",
      "Gosh, yeah that was cold hearted! He was a weirdo though. Ya know Katy was a Christian singer to begin with and then moved to the pop music with her first official album. She also tied Michael Jackson once.\n",
      "Well I have to go, nice chatting with you\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you? Do you know much about tennis?\n",
      "Yes I love tennis. I used to play it a lot when I was a kid, what about you?\n",
      "I never really played the sport. Maybe a couple of times. It always seemed complicated. Especially the score.\n",
      "Yes the scoring is kind of weird for sure. Also weird is that until 1978 you could use any object as a racket, not just a tennis racket\n",
      "How often did people show up with something different? That would be strange. I heard that they used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US open. That's probably how I would have handled it, too. LOL\n",
      "Haha it's a good idea though! Just think what else could they have done? what's weird is that tennis is not very popular, soccer is the most popular sport because it makes more money than all other sports combined\n",
      "Soccer is easy for anyone to play. Just a ball and a flat area. Not really any special equipment.\n",
      "Yes that's a good point. I do think, thinking back to tennis though, that the longest point was a rally that lasted 29 minutes, that's so exhausting!\n",
      "I can't imagine. They must have collapsed. The fans must have collapsed too. \n",
      "Yep it was made of a 643 shot rally back and forth, that would definitely Tire anyone out, also do you think that when a player grunts while theyre playing that that is a form of cheating?\n",
      "I don't. It probably sounds vulgar and classless to the elites that play and watch the game, but some people make noise. I think grunting shows intensity.\n",
      "Yep I agree, sometimes it's just a natural sound that you make too. What do you think about Serena Williams by the way?\n",
      "I think she has worked hard for her success. I heard that she said she would not retire when she was tired of tennis, but when she was tired of practicing.\n",
      "It's impressive that she was born in 1981. That makes her four years older than me but incredibly much better at tennis LOL\n",
      "I  think that she has been involved since she was young. It takes a lifetime to get to her level. I guess she could raise her kids to be players, or become a coach.\n",
      "She seems very successful though. I never realized that she was a co-owner of the dolphins\n",
      "Yes, she plowed that cash into a great investment that will grow forever.\n",
      "Yep I agree with you. I also didn't know she does a character voice in The Cartoon Avatar, she is very talented\n",
      "What? That is a strange fact. I guess she had a chance to do the voice work. She is a celebrity, after all.\n",
      "Did you ever play tennis? serena has been playing since she was 13, which is about when I started playing, but she's obviously way better LOL\n",
      "I assumed that she started sooner. She must have picked it up quick. I didn't real play. Anyway, great chat! Thanks!\n",
      "Yep thank you too, keep in mind Serena Williams is the first player ever, male or female, to achieve the career golden slam which is incredible\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey, how are you?   Did you know that moon dust was harmful to humans?  I had no idea.\n",
      "Me neither, I remember how they were so careful about stuff that came back from the moon thought it was all benign.  \n",
      "I wonder if it's just the our moon's dust or if it's all moon's dust that is harmful.  \n",
      "It seems like they are all so different. Like Titan may have methane based life.  I guess we'll just have to go see.\n",
      "Something to look forward to right?  Have you been to any good movies lately?  Do you try and see ones that are box office hits or do you choose a movie for other reasons?\n",
      "I rarely go to, or even watch any movies.  I'm too fidgety and anyway they're not very good.  Like Titanic was supposed to be so great but I never could bring myself to like DiCaprio.\n",
      "Oh wow.  I love movies.  But I can see why you wouldn't.  I'm not a fan of DiCaprio either.   I wanted to like him after seeing What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but with each show after I liked him less and less.\n",
      "Maybe I should have look at Gilbert Grape, that was his first big role I guess. Got him an oscar nomination, never won one for real though.  Surprising for the amount of box office he's generated.\n",
      "I don't follow the awards very close.  I find I usually don't like the movies that are hits with the critics or generate huge box office revenue.  I'm never heartbroken over who doesn't win LOL.  I do love Tom Hanks though.  In my eyes he is a great actor.  I don't think I've seen a movie of his I didn't like if not love.\n",
      "Yeah, Hanks has a way of pulling off so many different roles.  $8.5 billion in total box office.  And he's worth it. amazing range of roles.\n",
      "I will always go to a movie he's in no matter what it's about.  Watching him in Apollo 11 is what got me more interested in space that anything else.  Up until then I had no idea the moon had mountains and valleys like the Earth.  Even high than Mt. Everest!\n",
      "That mountain is really shocking, considering how small and dense the moon is.  Did you know that NASA actually considered putting a United Nations flag on the moon instead of U.S.  That would have shook up things!\n",
      "Oh wow!  Can you imagine?  It's such a source of pride here in the US.  I'm glad it went the way it did.  Did you know our moon is the 5th largest satellite  in the Solar System?  \n",
      "Dunno about that.  But consider this, if DiCaprio played the astronaut in Apollo 11 then we could have a new record for box office flop. That would have been huge!\n",
      "So true!  And no awards for that show since he seems to have a weird ability to not win any, deserved or not.   Maybe working with Brad Pitt on Growing Pains jinxed him.  Brad can't seem to do anything wrong.\n",
      "look what happened to Matthew Perry, I'm wonder if he regrets sticking with TV?  Lots of work putting a show out every week and not as much money although I'm sure it's plenty.\n",
      "That's true too.  I know Matthew Perry made at least one movie, I see it on TV once in a while but don't think I've ever watched start to finish so I'm not sure if it's good or not.  I'd have to check the box office numbers to see if it was considered a success or not.  \n",
      "We didn't mention the Revenant.  My Montana brother who's into that era history thought it was accurate. And DiCaprio really earned his money in that one getting beat up all the time.  Or his double did,\n",
      "Well, maybe there is hope for DiCaprio after all.  I've heard some good things about that movie.  It's been fun chatting with you.  I'm in the mood to pop some popcorn and watch a Tom Hanks flick!\n",
      "Good idea.  Maybe you have encouraged me to see one too.  Even if it is a flop, that can be a source of pride too.  After all Sleeping Beauty was a box office flop too.\n",
      "Well if you do I hope you enjoy it!!  It's only a flop if you don't like it and I love most things Disney.  Treasure Plant however was a box off flop that deserved that title for sure!\n",
      "Enjoy what's in front of you, not a bad idea.\n",

      "I always thought that there was only one type of hockey - ice hockey.\n",
      "What other kinds of hockey are there? Are they in the Olympics?\n",
      "The other type is field hockey.  I do not think it is in the Olympics?\n",
      "Field hockey? I wonder why anyone would play that instead of soccer.\n",
      "I don't know but Canada has ice hockey as one of their national sports.\n",
      "What's the other national sport? I thought Canadians talked and dreamed only about hockey.\n",
      "The other one is lacrosse.\n",
      "Lacrosse is a grass sport, so I guess they play that in the summer. I don't know how well Canadian do internationally in lacrosse, but they sure do well internationally. They have a real rivalry with the US.\n",
      "The US is just started to be competitive in ice hockey. A hockey player was traded for $1 in 1993 - do you know if it was a Canadian or American player?\n",
      "I don't know. I would suspect that the Canadians would not go to the US for only $1.\n",
      "You are right. Somehow I thought it was $1M and it was just a typo.\n",
      "I've heard that hockey players can lose tons of weight in just one game. Serious exertion there.\n",
      "Up to 8 pounds!  That was what I heard.\n",
      "I suppose that's mostly water. They can regain fluids pretty fast. \n",
      "And it applies to professional hockey players mostly since they take hockey very seriously.\n",
      "I always wondered how sports stadiums switched between basketball and hockey. The rink is right under the court!\n",
      "I don't know how it works.  I wish I knew the explanation.\n",
      "I think they reassemble the floor in pieces over top the rink. \n",
      "I'll bet Canada has dedicated ice hockey rings since the sport is their pride and joy.  Perhaps basketball/hockey stadiums are only in the US.  I don't know.\n",
      "The only place that could have both is Toronto. The Raptors share a space with the Leafs, I believe, right in downtown Toronto. \n",
      "It is good to know.  I've got to run now.  It was really nice chatting with you.\n",

      "Afternoon! A fan of Hockey?\n",
      "I do like hockey! What about you?\n",
      "I've been a bigger fan in the past. I was a Caps fan growing up.\n",
      "I am a Caps fan too! Do you know how much a player loses weight per game?\n",
      "Like 8 pounds. I assume that's mostly sweat.\n",
      "Yes! I cannot believe they drop that much weight!\n",
      "There was a hockey player traded for $1 in 1993.\n",
      "I heard he went on to win 4 stanely cups!\n",
      "Good for him. Sticking it to the man! \n",
      "Have you seen the movie frozen?\n",
      "I have listened to it probably 15 times as my kids have watched it on long road trips. But I've never actually \"seen\" it.  You?\n",
      "Yes, I love that movie!\n",
      "It sounds like a great movie. \"Let it Go\" sure sticks in your head.\n",
      "Did you know that before let it go was written, elsa was the main villian?\n",
      "Really? I suppose that would humanize her.\n",
      "The song was so uplifting her character was changed instead of the song.\n",
      "The guy who co-wrote that song also wrote music for the Scrubs musical. I loved that episode.\n",
      "The person won an emmy, a grammy, an oscar, and a tony!\n",
      "4 FTW! Jennifer Lee the director of frozen was the first female director for a Disney animated film. Good on her for doing such a great job.\n",
      "I agree! I hope she directs more movies.\n",
      "Nice chatting!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you enjoy hockey?\n",
      "I actually really enjoy it, and I've been playing my whole life, both ice, and ball hockey. How about you?\n",
      "Oh, wow. I like to watch but could never play. I was stunned when I recently learned that an ice hockey rink just remains under a basketball court when they switch it. \n",
      "Yeah, it's insane how fast they do the conversion too. In less than 24 hours, they are able to completely transform the whole arena, from basketball floor, to ice. It's funny, back in the day, hockey rinks only used to have one penalty box for both teams, so you'd have players from opposing teams, fight with each other in the boxes!\n",
      "Oh wow! That is impressive. I didn't know they put them in the same box either. That's a recipe for disaster. Did you know that Canada has two national sports?\n",
      "Interesting. you'd think that Canada's national sport would only be hockey, but I guess there's another sport, just as popular. Hockey is an interesting sport. you usually think of hockey games as being low scoring, but the Slovakian women's hockey team, once beat Bulgaria 82-0, it was ridiculous.\n",
      "I can't imagine a hockey game scoring that high. I'm surprised when a team scores 5 or over. I can't see how it's possible to score 82. \n",
      "It was a crazy game, they averaged 1 goal every 44 seconds. They would basically win the face-off, and center ice, and skate down, and score, every play.\n",
      "Wow! I wonder what in the world the goalie was doing. Did you know that the average professional hockey players loses up to 8 pounds in one hockey game?!\n",
      "seriously?! I had no idea. No wonder they have been known to bulk up with pasta's and heavy meals before games, because they know that they'd lose that weight anyway, haha\n",
      "I would think you would have to load up or you'd pass out. Do you enjoy wrestling at all? Traditional or the flashy soapy kind?\n",
      "I used to watch wrestling a lot as a kid, but nowadays, the story lines have just become ridiculous, and unwatchable to me. One of my favorite wrestlers was Macho Man, did you know he was actually signed to play with the St. Louis Cardinals, before he started wrestling? That guy was talented.\n",
      "Oh I remember Macho Man. No I did not know that. It's very interesting. Were you aware that Abe Lincoln is in the wrestling hall of fame?\n",
      "I did know that he was a wrestler, but didn't know that he was in the hall of fame, that's awesome.\n",
      "He was very accomplished. He only lost once in around 300 matches. Very impressive. \n",
      "Wow, in today's world, that would, that would probably make him one of the top athletes. Neil Degrasse Tyson was actually undefeated in his high school wrestling career, and even wrestled for Harvard, but I have no idea how many matches he fought in\n",
      "I did not know that about Tyson. He's a big man but I didn't peg him as an athlete. Before becoming a philosopher, Plato was also a professional wrestler. \n",
      "See, that makes sense to me, because Plato was Greek, and Greek wrestling was hugely popular, and still is.\n",
      "It makes sense to me as well. Since you mentioned Macho Man earlier, did you know that his outfits were designed by the same person who designed clothing for Jimi Hendrix and Aerosmith?\n",
      "You know, I did not know that, but now that I think of it, that would completely make sense. Those guys had a great fashion sense, and Macho Man definitely looked similar to them.\n",
      "Yes they all had very flashy outfits. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you tonight?\n",
      "good, what do you think about womens hockey?\n",
      "I don't know much about hockey. I suppose the women's game has its appeal.\n",
      "same, did you know they play in the Olympics?\n",
      "Yes. I expect women's hockey to be just as serious and competitive as the men's. \n",
      "maybe, the canadian womens beat the usa five straight games\n",
      "A lot of canadians begin skating very young.\n",
      "true! did u know the ice hockey ring remains under the basketball court when they switch sports?\n",
      "I guess they have to make best use of the space. The sport is intense. Players can lose up to 8 pounds in one game.\n",
      "hum, maybe I should play ha\n",
      "Tough way to lose weight! Wrestling might be a more fun way.\n",
      "yes, and who knew abe lincoln is in the wrestling hall of fame\n",
      "Abe was the man! He was like, 6-5, tall, but really good at wrestling. I don't think he ever tried oil wrestling.\n",
      "funny image, Plato was a wrestler too\n",
      "Probably the origins of Greco-Roman wrestling go back to that time. A good way to stay fit. I wonder whether women wrestled then.\n",
      "i would think probably not, but not sure\n",
      "Women in different parts of Greece took different roles. Perhaps it varied across the area. Plus there was lots of olive oil around.\n",
      "ha yes, how about those outfits, the man that designed macho mans also did clothes for aerosmith\n",
      "Flamboyant outfits! Well, I've had a groovy time chatting with you!\n",
      "same:)\n",
      "Bye\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "do you like the Avengers movies?\n",
      "Yes I do. the Infinity War is the first one to be filmed with imax cameras\n",
      "Yeah. Do you know who is the waitress that is saved by captain america?\n",
      "Yes that was the same person that voice Gretchen in Recess\n",
      "yeah. Do you know who played the Hulk in the 90s?\n",
      "Yes that was Lou Ferrigno and he still does the voice of Hulk\n",
      "Yeah. Because of the movie, the shawarma sales really went up\n",
      "Cool. The guy who voiced Jarvis has never seen the movie\n",
      "WOw cool . Do you know when the Infinity War came out?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes that was in 2018 and it was released in 3D as well\n",
      "Yeah those are awesome. On another topic, do you like Brady?\n",
      "I sure do. Did you know his wife makes double what he makes?\n",
      "Yes she is super rich too. Brady is always in the injury report\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes the coach seems to like to list him in the weekly report\n",
      "Yeah. He has never eaten a strawberry in his life\n",
      "I wonder if he is allergic or just not a fan of them\n",
      "I have no idea. with his current team, he has either won or lost the super bowl by 3 or 4 points\n",
      "\n",
      "Cool. Do you know who John McCain is?\n",
      "Yes the Arizona Senator. He was really against a MLK Day to be a national holiday\n",
      "WOw that is sad. His mom is still alive and she even took race-car driving lessons not too long ago\n",
      "Wow go woman. Nice chat\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello! Do you watch football?  What do you think of Tom Brady, the Patriot's quarterback?\n",
      "Hi.  I rarely watch football.  I think Brady is good looking and clearly he's good at what he does.  A lot of people seem to hate him though.  I think I saw what he wore to the met gala\n",
      "I didn't hear about that or see anything of it?  What did he wear?\n",
      "It was just a tux with gold embroidery like the article says.  If I remember the theme was something about the popes/catholic church so some people went all out\n",
      "Oh I see.  Well I know his wife is a super model. I hear she makes more than twice he does a year.\n",
      "I didn't know that, but good for her.  Their kids have probably hit the genetic jackpot.   Why would they list him every week on the injury report when he's not hurt?\n",
      "I bet they do that to mess with the other team.  You know what I think is odd about Brady?  He has never eaten a strawberry before!\n",
      "Which is a really weird thing for anyone to know.  Unless you're allergic I don't know how you get to your 30s without eating a strawberry.\n",
      "I know, it's so bizarre.  I've heard he and his wife, Gisele Bundchen, are on special diets.  Strawberries are a fruit so why not eat them?\n",
      "Or, maybe its some kind of sports superstition thing.  I didn't know he wasn't picked until the 6th round.  Pretty good deal for the patriots back then I'm sure\n",
      "It did turn out to be a good deal for them.  Since he was picked in the 6th round do you know if they intended him to be their starter or if they had another quarterback that he replaced at some point?\n",
      "How about the Avengers?  Are you a superhero movie person?\n",
      "I like some of them.  I haven't seen Infinity War yet.  I think that's the one with Guardians of the Galaxy in it. Have you seen it?\n",
      "I get the movies mixed up, but I did see the one with the Guardians.  They're ok for light entertainment.  Its kind of cute they got matching tattoos together\n",
      "Who got matching tattoos?  I've only seen that actual Guardians movie, not any with them as additional characters.\n",
      "The article says the avengers got tattoos, except Mark Ruffalo for some reason.  \n",
      "Did you know that the avengers movie caused sales in shawarmas to go up?\n",
      "I don't know what shawarmas are??  I've never seen the original hulk tv series, but I'm kind of surprised lou ferrigno is still around\n",
      "I've seen repeats of the original hulk show.  It was pretty good.  Lou Ferrigno played the hulk while Bill Bixby played Bruce.\n",
      "And he's still dong voice work, good for him.  Bill Bixby  I've never heard of\n",
      "I think he was a popular actor back in the 1970s.  It is cool that even though they may replace the hulk physically Ferrigno is still his voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you follow tennis at all?\n",
      "Only occasionally when there's a big tournament like Wimbledon, or if I see a big name like Serena Williams. What about you?\n",
      "I like Roger and Rafa\n",
      "I don't think I've heard of them. Are they major players?\n",
      "They are on the men's side\n",
      "I don't know many men's players besides Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic.\n",
      "Do you recall who the only black man to win a U.S. title was?\n",
      "I can't say I do. Who was it?\n",
      "Arthur Ashe\n",
      "That name sounds familiar, now that you mention it. Does he still play tennis?\n",
      "No, he has passed away. Serena and Venus are the only black champions around today.\n",
      "They are both amazing players. Serena has been #1 in Women's Tennis for over six years in total.\n",
      "What are we going to do when Serena leaves the game. Who is the next major player to take her spot?\n",
      "Angelique Kerber did beat Serena at Wimbledon last year, though I don't think her overall record can match Serena's.\n",
      "She did well and Serena lost the U.S Open too\n",
      "The one who won the U.S. Open (Naomi Osaka, I think her name was?) was an amazing player. She could easily be one to rise to the #1 spot in the future.\n",
      "Agreed. I do like her alot. I think she is the future of tennis for sure.\n",
      "I wonder if we'll ever see someone break the record that Serena shares with Steffi Graf for holding the #1 place the longest.\n",
      "Steffi is my all time favorite player. I think her and Serena could beat many of the high ranked men on the tournament.\n",
      "Serena and Venus once said they could beat any man ranked 200 or lower, and the 203rd ranked male player beat them both, even though they're both incredible.\n",
      "Serena was pregnant when she last won the Australian, how amazing is that!\n",
      "That's mind-blowing! Think of how many people can't do that even when they aren't pregnant.\n",
      "I believe Serena has been at the top of her peers about 319 weeks. (Please hit done as my button is not working).\n",
      "Serena definitely has earned her spot. (No problem, mine just lit up this turn!)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi there. You a tennis fan. I played a lot. I love that you can play singles or doubles!\n",
      "I'm not really. I like that grunting lady though, what is her name? She grunts a lot. Some in the tennis circle consider grunting before a shot to be a kind of cheating.\n",
      "Haha oh Maria Sharapova maybe? A black man won the 1st US open title despite everyone calling it a country club sport!\n",
      "That's interesting! Was that before 1978? That is when tennis players had to stop using just any object as a racket.\n",
      "Yes it was it was in 1968! \n",
      "I have a lot of admiration for the Williams sisters.\n",
      "As do I. Once I met them and got their autograph! Gael Monfils is a tennis player but he beat one of the best paddle tennis players too!\n",
      "Nice! It's cool that Serena is a co-owner of the Miami Dolphins now as well.\n",
      "Yeah that is very neat. They also speak fluent french and italian!\n",
      "Nice! I wonder how they found time for anything besides tennis, ha. It's cool that Serena Williams is the first tennis player, man or woman, to have ever gotten the career golden slam.\n",
      "Agreed. That is a huge accomplishment. In 2007 Serena was ranked 95th but still beat out Sharapove for the Australian Open title.\n",
      "I also cannot believe that Serena WIlliams went pro at age 13.\n",
      "Yeah that is mind blowing. She even won her 23rd grand slam while 2 months pregnant. \n",
      "That is an amazing feat. Speaking of grand slams, Roger Federer didn't win any in 2011 but he ended Djokovci's 43 match winning streak.\n",
      "That is still a big accomplishment! Federer is the man! He was number one for 310 weeks!\n",
      "And he has never retired from a match once it has started. He has been on tour for more than 13 years\n",
      "Amazing. In 2007 he played Nadal on a court that was half grass and half clay!\n",
      "Wow, how does that work? It's ironic how he got super injured though.\n",
      "Yeah too bad. Federer is so good in addition to medals he has been gifted 2 cows over the years!\n",
      "Ironic that he didn't get injured on the court but when he stretched too fair while preparing a bath for his daughter! Also I wonder what he did with those cows.\n",
      "Yeah my thoughts exactly. He even has a stamp in Switzerland! Have a good day!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How much do you know about tennis?\n",
      "I heard that Tiafoe played Mannarino of France during the first round of the U.S. Open in August of 2018.  Tiafoe is only 20 and from Maryland.\n",
      "How did he do? Pro tennis at 20 is very good\n",
      "He beat Mannarino despite having a wild crowd.   He had in prior competition lost blaming his nerves, but won that match with Mannarino.\n",
      "Thats a pretty big upset! I wonder how he would far against the likes of Federer\n",
      "He was so excited to win.   He had in the past beet Troicki as a teen, Isner in 2016 and pushed Federer to five sets last year.\n",
      "Thats really good. Against the guy thats rank #3 in the world\n",
      "He will have to face Alex de Minaur in the second round in Arthur Ashe Stadium.  I remember Arthur Ashe as a tennis great.\n",
      "Hopefully it will a good match and doesn't take 11 hours to play!\n",
      "Do you follow women's tennis?  Simona Halep is ranked No. 1 and lost in the first round\n",
      "I do. Its crazy how some of these upsets happen. I think Serena is one of the best women ever\n",
      "It must be interesting to be a twin player.  Do they still wear polo shirts in the competitions?  They were originally invented by Rene \"the Crocodile\" Lacoste but adopted by polo players.\n",
      "I believe a lot of the men do. Serena wear a catsuit i think. Outside of the french open where its banned\n",
      "I wonder how many African Americans are in professional tennis.  Only one has won the US Open Title in 1968 and none since.\n",
      "thats crazy to think about. Especially with how good Serena has been.\n",
      "Well, my mistake I meant African men in tennis.  I'm not sure about womens' records.  Serena Williams has ranked third in the \"Open Era.\"  She has the most Grand Slam titles in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles.\n",
      "I guess it might be hard considering 3 men have 56% of the grand slams since 2000\n",
      "That may be a confounding factor. I wonder how long it took the helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US open.\n",
      "Must have been a lot of rain I wonder if they have changed any drainage since then\n",
      "You would think so.  Good thing for paddle tennis though!  You can play indoors.  US Open quarterfinalist Gael Monfils beat the \"roger federer of paddle tennis\" just days after learning how to play paddle tennis.\n",
      "Thats some Forrest Gump skill\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "Doing well! I have played a lot of tennis, never 11 hours of a single match though. \n",
      "So you're a slacker??? Just kidding! 11 hours is too long for any sport!\n",
      "haha, i know im lazy! I agree! I wish they had another black player who won the title! \n",
      "Is Keys black?\n",
      "Im not sure who Keys is, but the 1st US tennis title was won by a black man and then never since! \n",
      "Really? Ashe never won one? Or was that Ashe?\n",
      "wowo! Yeah that was Ashe! \n",
      "I wish my useless sports knowledge could be monetized. I would have so much more money... I didn't know they used a chopper to dry the courts in 1969.\n",
      "Thats a crazy idea, right? I wonder if it threw water at the crowd! \n",
      "Like Shamu splashing water on the front row of sea world? Did you watch the Australian Open?\n",
      "i kept up on it! didnt Serena lose? \n",
      "Yeah. I was at the gym when Nadal got handled by Djokavich. It wasn't even close. He got crushed!\n",
      "Have you heard about a game that federer played that had a special court? \n",
      "No, What was it?\n",
      "It was made of half clay & grass. Seems weird! \n",
      "Do you know who he played? Was it Nadal to see who was the best player? Nadal is awesome on clay whereas Federer is a grass plaayer.\n",
      "It was those 2 players. Maybe it was to give them both their best advantage and see who won? \n",
      "I just read that.... I was on factual section 2... Just caught up! I was surprised when Federer was bounced from the Australian. He lost to the 16th ranked player...\n",
      "Hes way too good to lose to a 16th ranked player! \n",
      "Agreed! Nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you like watching tennis?\n",
      "Once in a while. I like Serena Williams and her sister Venus. How about you?\n",
      "I really like the Williams sisters. Serena is tough. She won her 23rd grand slam tournamend while sh ewas two months pregnant.\n",
      "That's awesome! She was ranked 95th in the world, but still won the Australian Open in 2007, too. \n",
      "I believe she has reached number one after that too. So I'm not sure how she found time to do anything besides tennis, but she and her sister are fluent in French and Italian.\n",
      "Wow. That's neat! She's been number one for 319 weeks!\n",
      "Cool, and she's also a co owner of the Miami Dolphins. \n",
      "I didn't realize that. She is the same age as Roger Federer. \n",
      "\n",
      "If Federer gets his sixth U.S Open trophy in September, he will be the tournament's oldest winner in the Open Error.\n",
      "Pretty cool! He has his own stamp in Switzerland. \n",
      "Sorry I meant era, not error, haha! He is 18-0 in opening round matches. I don't know too much about tennis but that sounds pretty good.\n",
      "Sounds good to me, too! He has his worst injury when he was filling the bathtub for his kids.\n",
      "Wow, sounds pretty ironic. I totally understand the painful stretching you do when having to tend to children though, haha\n",
      " Same here! He actually tore his meniscus doing that. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if he tends to his cows himself? He has been gifted two cows over his career.\n",
      "That's a strange gift!\n",
      "I know, right. One was for the 2003 Wimbledon and one for the 2013 swiss open.\n",
      "He must be pretty popular since he's ranked 3rd. \n",
      "He has also won the most Grand Slam singles titles out of anyone in history for a male player.\n",
      "Wow! The longest tennis match lasted 11 hours!\n",
      "I totally would not watch that! Hah!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi, do you like tennis?\n",
      "Hello - I do like tennis. What about you? \n",
      "yeah me too. do you like serena williams?\n",
      "Yep I think she is really good at tennis. \n",
      "yes she is for sure. did you know she was pregant when she she won the 23 grand slam?\n",
      "Oh wow I didn't know that. Pretty crazy. Did you know she is the co-owner of the Miami Dolphins? \n",
      "that is amazing,a businesswoman too. she speaks many languages too\n",
      "I didn't know she spoke many languages. Sounds like she does it all.\n",
      "yeah she speaks italian, french, as does her sister\n",
      "That's pretty cool. Did you know she went pro in tennis at age 13? \n",
      "That woman is all talent. do you know how polo short became famous?\n",
      "Yes she is. I have no idea how Polo became famous. How did they?\n",
      "rene lacoste , the tennis player  invented them \n",
      "Oh wow that's cool. Is that the Lacoste brand? \n",
      "yeah it is, so it was just adopted by other players later\n",
      "Got it, that makes sense. Did you know that up until 1978, a tennis player could use any object as a racket? \n",
      "wow, wonder how that worked out. did you know they once used a helicopter to dry a tennis court?\n",
      "HAHA that's hilarious, but I bet it worked pretty well!\n",
      "yes, right? do you know how long the longest tennis match lasted?\n",
      "I do not, how long? \n",
      "11 hours over three days. nice chat\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you know much about tennis?\n",
      "No. But I do like to watch it. Did you hear about Novak Djokovic sides with Serena Williams?\n",
      "Yes I remember, it was in the final of the US open last year.\n",
      "Yes. Serena was fined 17,000 by the U.S. Tennis Association for cascading  code violation after being issued a warning.\n",
      "I guess she was losing the final and got angry and started yelling at the umpire.  I feel bad for the winner, all the focus is on Serena, not the person that won.\n",
      "Yes you have a point. A lot of emotions that day. But plenty of  people pointed out that male stars have not being penalized for worse comments.\n",
      "I know she has a bit of history of bad behavior on the tennis court, probably counted against her.\n",
      "Ok. Did not know that. There is also an opinion that the chair umpire should not have pushed Serena to the limit, especially in a Grand Slam final, \n",
      "Do you watch much tennis?  I really like to see Roger Federer, he's really stylish when he's playing.\n",
      "No, I do not. But yes Roger Federer is stylish even though Novak Djokovic has more career earnings than Roger Federer.\n",
      "Tennis is actually a good subject for me, I was born in a town next to Wimbledon, I went to one of the schools from which they picked the ball boys and girls.\n",
      "Ok. That sounds interesting. Speaking about tennis. Did you know that until 1978 a tennis player was allowed to use any object as racket?\n",
      "They should keep that rule, no one is ever going to break it, but I'd love to see someone come onto the court with something different, maybe a snow shoe.\n",
      "Lol... Yes, wishing to see another record, do you remember The longest point in pro tennis history was a 643-shot rally that lasted for 29 minutes?\n",
      "I think I might have switched off after shot 300.  Another long one was the game that went over three days.\n",
      "Ok. Did you know that Serena Williams is a coowner of Miami Dolphins?\n",
      "I wasn't aware of that.  She could take out some of her anger issues with the football players.  She's won so many tournaments that she must have a few dollars, plus the sponsorship's.\n",
      "I think she did good for herself. She went pro in tennis at the age of 13 and is the first tennis player to achieve the career golden slam.\n",
      "Wow, 13 seems really young.  That's a lot of pressure on a kids, but I suppose if you are good enough then play.  I know that typically female tennis players mature a lot earlier than the men.\n",
      "Ok. Did not know. I think I'll start to watch more of tennis, even though soccer makes more money than football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and hockey combined, and I do like to watch soccer more than tennis.\n",
      "It was good chatting with you, have a good day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a pro tennis fan?\n",
      "I am and I really like Serena Williams, how about you?\n",
      "Same. I was very upset with the ump during the U.S. Open and agreed with her frustration.\n",
      "Agreed! Carlos Ramos is a great player as well.\n",
      "I don't think she should have been fined, certainly not $17K!\n",
      "I know! That was just wrong. I think if it would have been a male that wouldn't have happened.\n",
      "It was great to see her get the support she did from her fellow players\n",
      "Yes it was. It has to be tough on them and when they are playing under such a high stand\n",
      "I think Osaka conducted herself in a dignified manner after all the drama during the match. She was very respectful of WIlliams and her frustration.\n",
      "I agree, I think Serena is very talented and she does have many who follow and love her.\n",
      "Osaka played well but I believe the ump stole the title from WIlliams and gave it to Naomi.\n",
      "Yes, that ump has a reputation and not a good one.\n",
      "I would hope the USTA would also fine the Ump just as much but the USTA seems to be standing behind him instead of the future Hall of Famer\n",
      "I totally agree. They need to have something in place for these ump's. It is just not right. \n",
      "The whole incident was replayed on just about every news outlet in the world to include Williams' interviews  after the match. You could see Ramos was wrong.\n",
      "Definitely! It's plain and simple he crossed the line. Ump's are only there to analyze the match not act out.  I didn't know this but interesting that Serena Williams is a co owner of The miami dolphins. \n",
      "She has been ranked #1 since 2002, she should have been given the benefit of the doubt.\n",
      "I agree, she won her 23rd grand slam in2017 she is amazing\n",
      "She is an amazing woman for sure. She also speaks Italian and French\n",
      "Very talented. In 2007 she was ranked 95th in the world!\n",
      "I think she could beat a majority of the ranked male players on the tour too\n",
      "Oh definitely! The WTA ranked her world #1 in singles for 8 occasions.\n",
      "I must admit though that my all time favorite women's player is Steffi Graf without a doubt. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Are you into professional tennis?  I watch it a little, particularly Wimbledon...\n",
      "I do not follow it a lot but a friend does.  I hear there is a new guy named Tiafoe\n",
      "Yeah, I don't know him.  I know Federer, Nadal, Murry and a few others. \n",
      "Yes I like the Williams sisters.  Serena is an amazing player\n",
      "I've lost track of women's although I know them from other media exposure.  \n",
      "Yes she has been ranked number 1 on 8 different occasions\n",
      "Wow, that's some record.  I didn't realize Arthur Ashe had a stadium named after him.  \n",
      "Yes.  Arthur Ashe was an amazing player who died of AIDS sadly.\n",
      "I knew he was dead... I heard he got AIDS from a blood transfusion. Sad.  \n",
      "Yes.  Only one black man has ever won the US Open and that was back in 1968\n",
      "Who was that?  A little before my time.  I did realize that polo shirts originated with Lacoste... Good ol' Izod...\n",
      "For sure.   Did you know that the longest tennis match was 11 hours long?\n",
      "I bet that caused some tennis elbow.  I wonder who was playing.  Probably a game like a Federer and Nadal match-up. \n",
      "I am not sure but it took 3 days to finish!\n",
      "That's crazy.  The fans sure got their money's worth.  I bet the Williams sisters could have a match like that.\n",
      "For sure.  They are amazing players!  And they both speak fluent french and italian!\n",
      "I wish I were more versatile language wise.  I could communicate at Wimbledon and a U.S. Open.  I'd be lost if it weren't in English. \n",
      "I learned Italian and French in school and am teaching myself Italian.  I love languages.\n",
      "Cool.  My degrees are in engineering where electives were few.  Some actually consider computer languages  a \"language.\"  I don't think so... I couldn't speak to the WIlliams sisters in Java...\n",
      "Yes I know a lot of computer languages as well but my degree was in math!   I did not know Serena was a co-owner of the Miami Dolphins!\n",
      "Tennis has been very good to her.  Also Federer... I bet Switzerland makes him their president...\n",
      "Yes he has won 56% of men's grand slam titkles since 2000\n",
      "If he wasn't so charming I'd swear he's some kind of tennis robot.  \n",
      "His biggest industry ever he got while drawing a bath for his daughter!\n",

      "Did you hear Roger Federer lost?\n",
      "To Nadal?\n",
      "I am not sure, lol. I guess I should have said \"stumbe\" Im referring to the articles on the left.\n",
      "Federer is a fantastic player, hes been on the scene for 13 years.\n",
      "I wish I was good at Tennis. I am too short. Do you watch it a lot?\n",
      "I dont catch too much of it.  It is a long game to watch.\n",
      "Sweet. Did you know Serena Williams is married to the guy who runs Reddit?\n",
      "No, honestly I dont even know who runs reddit.  LOL\n",
      "Alexis Ohanian. They have a daughter together. Are you a researcher or an mturk worker??\n",
      "Worker.  You?\n",
      "worker as well. I like these HITs, since they give us topics to talk about. I end up learning a lot of random stuff lol. Like that polo shirts were invinted for tennis by rene lacoste, and then later adopted by polo players.\n",
      "Yeah, and his nickname was the crocodile, hence the little crocodile on their shirts.\n",
      "They should just called them \"Tennis\". Like, \"hey, can you pick me up some tennis while you're there?\" instead of \"Polos\"\n",
      "I wonder why they took on the name polo, maybe they didnt catch on in tennis until a bit later.\n",
      "Meh. Did you know no black man has won a US Open since 1968?\n",
      "I didnt, I do know that they were allowed to use any item as a racket until 1978.\n",
      "lol that's awesome\n",
      "I could totally see someone using their shoe or something crazy like that in a pinch.\n",
      "And you just know someone tried to just use their palms/fist\n",

      "Do you frequent the library?\n",
      "I do, I use to use it alot more. How about you?\n",
      "Same. It is a same considering it is such a vast and valuable resource\n",
      "Agree.now that they have video games more teenagers going.\n",
      "They are trying to make a library of things that allows patrons to use useful things they need, but don't need to own long term\n",
      "yes, The library with its vast of information can help those without access to the internet do incredible things. Like a Malawian teenager who maked a windwill from the books.\n",
      "I mean a man used the library to prove his innocence and become a lawyer while falsely imprisoned\n",
      "How great is that! So important. The library of Alexandria had a unique way of gathering books by making all ships visiting surrender their books for copy .\n",
      "They must have had a impressive collection\n",
      "How unfair, they would copy their books give them back the copy and keep the originals.\n",
      "I guess that is true. Do you think we will ever have a centralized digital library of all our works and knowledge?\n",
      "I think so, The entertainment executive that wouldn't hire for a role, got it wrong with Ronald Reagan, not having the look. lol\n",
      "I guess he wasn't president like for the executive, but enough so for most americans\n",
      "lol, yes. I knew he liked jelly bellies, they became very popular then. But, I didn't know they made blueberry flavor for him.\n",
      "Did you know he called ice cream nutritious and a wholesome food. If only that was true\n",
      "I wish it so. He was also a hero in high school, saving 77 lives as a lifeguard!\n",
      "That is no easy feat. He sure had an amazing career from a hollywood actor to president\n",
      "I agree. I like the respect he has given the military by returning the salute in 1981.\n",
      "Indeed I hope our next president would be of a similar caliber. In any case, thanks for chatting.\n",
      "Yes, you too. Have a nice day! good chat\n",
      "The same to you as well.\n",

      "Robert M. Higdon was a really good man, who had a short life.\n",
      "I agree with you, seeing the fact that he provided good company and work to those close to him. \n",
      "I am curious as to how he became so well connected in Washington, he seems to have had a lot of power.\n",
      "If you see in Article Section 2, you can see how his judgments lead to the success of the Reagan establishments. \n",
      "Oh, you are right, thanks. He really did have good judgements, he got to say at first-class hotels during his international travels.\n",
      "I too would provide the best service for my employers who brought in his quality of service! On a darker note, it's depressing to see how many deaths we had in 2018... \n",
      "He raised su much money, and had a good salary, I am curious as to what made him choose this path of employment.\n",
      "Well we can see how his fundraising tactics were successful. However, we can see how he may have been dishonest with the money received. \n",
      "Yeah I agree, I really hate it when someone who many people might lookup to isn't honest with their money, it can have a bad impact on them.\n",
      "Exactly. However, I am curious about whether or not Ronald Reagan's fame helped him in electing him for presidency. If you see in factual section 2. \n",
      "Hm, you are right, he did have a lot of connection in Washington. \n",
      "You know what I think it is? Education. Seeing how a man was false imprisoned and taught himself law to prove is innocence is note worthy. That's probably how these successful people did well in life\n",
      "That was note worthy, however there are often people who are born into a rich lifestyle that can get better quality education or know family or friends who are in high positions and I feel that is unfair. Aww, he had a little dog who was a certified therapy dog.\n",
      "Right?! That's probably why he did so well in office. I think if we all had certified therapy dogs to help us with out work, we'd get more done. \n",
      "It's my understanding that Mr. Hidgeon stayed with Patti Davis's mother, or Reagan's wife, that interests me.\n",
      "I agree with you. It's hard not to think that he was not only family associate but almost like a family member, given all that he did for their family. Do you think he would have run for presidency? \n",
      "He seemed quite interested in politics, I think he might have run if he hadn't died. There were several people who were popular who died in 2018.\n",
      "Yeah I agree with you. Given his background. Anthony B. was an inspiration to us all. \n",
      "Anthony B was 61, it must have been hard on his family, losing someone at that age.\n",
      "True, like Robert Higdon, he was successful in his area of expertise. Speaking of food related stuff, I wonder what Ronald Raegans favorite ice cream was. \n",
      "Good question! I know that he liked Ice Cream so much he established National Ice Cream Month.\n",
      "Is it bad that everyday is National Ice Cream month... But what's surprising is how there isn't much of a difference compared to a presidents list of duties. \n",
      "Presidents are so busy, many people don't realize things that they must do, or how they have to do it. Before the elections campaigning is a lot of hard work, they have to travel to so many different states.\n",
      "Exactly. I'm curious to know what it feels like to have that much power. Or at least be an affiliate to someone with high level of power. Kind of like Higdon's position. \n",
      "I know there's a documentary on Reagan's presidency, there are probably other documentaries that would give a perspective on what it's like to be President.\n",
      "Thanks for that! Would you want to have the name of a Prime minister or President? \n",
      "I would recommend Margaret Thatcher, she rose to power in Britain and the BBC ordered a documentary on her.\n",
      "Thank you. If you have time, I would suggest watching Anthony B's documentary on his food adventures. It was very nice talking to you. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you ever heard of Robert M. Higdon?  He's new to me.\n",
      "He is pretty new to me as well.  I heard he was big in the development of Reagan's Presidential Library.\n",
      "I've always been curious what a presidential library is.  Never been to one, have this picture in my head of a regular library, must be different.\n",
      "I wonder the same thing, I wonder if it is just a library that he helped to fund and sponsor, there is a museum too.  I wonder what that has in it.\n",
      "Seems he did similar thing for the British PM, Thatcher.\n",
      "Maybe he just really loved all that libraries have to offer and saw a lot of value in them. \n",
      "My daughter loves libraries, she loves to read.  I'm glad she does, she reads a book a day.  It saves us a lot of money.\n",
      "The UK PM back in 1895 founded a library and wheelbarrowed his collection of 32,000 books almost a mile to the library.  \n",
      "I hope it wasn't raining!  I might want to publish a book in Norway, a guaranteed 1000 sold to the government.\n",
      "Then they get put in libraries, so they are supporting authors and reading.  I think that is fantastic!\n",
      "Agreed, reading is wholesome and nutritious for the brain.  Not sure Reagan's idea that ice cream was the same for the body is right.\n",
      "He had some great ideas, that wasn't one of them.  I love ice cream and all, but it isn't exactly nutritious.  \n",
      "Were I to live in Japan and live to a 100, I could have my  ice cream in a silver cup from the PM.\n",
      "That is pretty cool, they probably had to start finding a cheaper way to make cups.  It seems that there would be a lot of people making it to 100 in Japan, versus the US.\n",
      "I like the idea of libraries expanding to other things, like the Sacramento library where you can get things that useful like sewing machines.\n",
      "I think that is a great idea, that way people can checkout things that they might need.  It is a great way of community sharing.\n",
      "I wonder if you can check out things from presidential libraries?  I suspect not, probably more like a museum.\n",
      "Probably, especially it there is unique things that can't be replaced.  One thing that is hopeful for the country is there are more libraries than mcdonalds in the US.  Yay for reading!\n",
      "Definitely not wholesome and nutritious.  I'm sure McDonald's are working on that one.\n",
      "There is a man who was wrongly convicted in jail and spent his time in the prison library reading law books and then became a lawyer.\n",
      "Probably a cheaper way than going to college and getting all those student loans.  Still, the environment would not be nice.\n",
      "He then used his skill to help others that were in his situation, falsely convicted people.  Which is pretty neat.\n",
      "Have a good, nice speaking with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ha! I always suspected this!  Aladdin's pants were modeled after mc hammer.\n",
      "haha the mystery has been solved!  Have you heard they are coming aout with a new Aladdin?  With Will Smith.\n",
      "Yeah, I've seen the stills. I don't like the way it looks really.\n",
      "Yeah, me either.  The previous makes you curious,  but then I saw some pics online,  now I just have mixed feelings. \n",
      "Disney has been making all these live-action remakes. Ugh. I'm not sure they are correct here about pants/trousers only existing because of horses. People in very cold countries wore them to keep warm too.\n",
      "Yeah,  that does seem odd when I read it too.  Different jobs in the olden times required pants as well.  I totally agree with the cold weather too. \n",
      "They must have left something out. Perhaps it should have read people in temperate climates began wearing pants to ride horses?\n",
      "Collinsville, il has a law that prohibits \"saggy pants.\"  I feel like this should be everywhere haha\n",
      "Saggy pants are annoying, but I don't see how they can legally force people not to dress like this.\n",
      "5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes.  Thats really interesting too.  \n",
      "Again, what do they mean by that? Last longer? Fit better?\n",
      "its very vague.  And if they already know this,  why dont they make shoes more like before.  \n",
      "Well, the shoes back then were often custom-made, that was why I assumed it might be better fitting.\n",
      "Putting dry tea bags in smelly shoes or gym bags will absorb the unpleasant odor.  Ive actually tried this with my snowboarding boots,  and it works really well. \n",
      "Tea leaves can cure a lot of problems. They could have explained the Stephon Marbury one better too. Was this a charity venture?\n",
      "I do not know. \n",
      "It sounds like it. Like how Paul Neman didn't get paid for his food company-the profits are donated to charity.\n",
      "Have you experience any virtual reality devises?\n",
      "yes, my cousin got one last Christmas. And one of my best friends also owns a headset. \n",
      "My brother in law has one,  that device is amazing.  Also,  really scary,  it was like a haunted house simulation or something. \n",
      "She had mostly outdoor scenes. This is cool-Lockheed martin has a virtual reality \"mars bus\" that can take kids on a tour of mars.\n",
      "That would be interesting to experience.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello.  What do you think of virtual reality?  I recently learned that the first virtual reality game was made in 1968!\n",
      "Hello, I'm a fan for sure! I think it's amazing being able to transport yourself to an imaginary environment and even look around and interact with things, I had no idea the technology existed that long ago!\n",
      "I didn't either until recently.  Some of it seems to be geared towards kids and I wish it wasn't.  Take for example lockheed martin. They have a virtual reality bus that takes kids on a tour of mars. I would like to do that too.\n",
      "That's crazy, I'm sure a lot of people take advantage of it. Although I wonder how kids feel with it, I know a lot of people experience motion sickness in virtual reality, maybe they couldn't handle it.\n",
      "I never thought about getting motion sickness from it before.  I guess it is possible since the brain is perceiving two realities.  \n",
      "I wonder if the headsets have improved since 1968. I know originally, it was a stereoscopic head-mounted display rendering computer-generated images, but I'm sure it was bulkier back then, and maybe lighter and easier to use now.\n",
      "With the improvements on computers the headsets are probably a lot smaller and lighter than before.  Did you know that the scientist who discovered some of saturn's moons thinks that we are living in a computer generated virtual reality?\n",
      "Wow, as much as I want to call him insane he seems more qualified than me, but I'm still a skeptic. Are you interested in clothing at all?\n",
      "I am interested in clothing.  I think it's very funny to realize that the romans thought that wearing pants was a sign of barbarism!\n",
      "Well I can see where they're coming from! I think the only reason people DO wear pants is because to ride a horse in an army, it was more effective to wear pants than robes.\n",
      "Yes it was unless you were in britain where they rode side saddle.  A lot of things are different there.  They consider trousers to be underwear where america considers trousers to be pants.\n",
      "That's really hard to imagine, for us I'm sure that seems insane. Then again, we have our own culture that dictates fashion, I know MC Hammer's pants inspired a lot of things, even Aladdin's pants!\n",
      "I never knew that!  I thought that Aladdin's pants were from how the people in that country dressed long ago.\n",
      "Ahah I thought so also, I guess the culture around pants has changed a lot in modern days. I remember one of the craziest things I saw in the news was a judge suing a dry cleaning business for over $67 million just over one pair of pants.\n",
      "Wow  i haven't heard about that! Why did he sue them?  Were the pants messed up in some way?\n",
      "I believe the pants got lost! Still that much money for one pair? Maybe he only had saggy pants left and was from Collinsville, Illinois where they prohibit them!\n",
      "That is way way too much money for one pair and I hope he lost his case.  However, being a judge he probably didn't. Now I do know about the Collinsville law.  What i would like to know is just how do they enforce it.  What is too saggy?\n",
      "Exactly! I wonder where the line ends too. I bet they have a similar rule for shoes, like you can't have shoes too dusty or something!\n",
      "Or too smelly!  What they need in that case is some dry tea bags. Those are supposed to absorb odors in shoes.\n",
      "I need to use that! I think I have old gym shoes that could use them. I definitely don't want to throw them out even though they are very old, because I believe very old shoes actually perform better than new shoes!\n",
      "Oh they definitely do!  Shoes as far back as 5000 years ago are made so much better than todays and out perform todays shoes by miles.\n",
      "That's crazy, I hope I can somehow find them on the market to test out the theory myself. Anyways, it was nice chatting with you, have a nice day!\n",

      "Are you a fan of Elton John?\n",
      "Hello there, I am not a big fan but think he is very talented. \n",
      "Based on my knowledge, I know that he sings with a sparkling outfit with a nice grand piano.\n",
      "Yeah he does, do you know he has sold more than 300 million records?!  That is very impressive. \n",
      "He will be a legend! I believe it's been 31 years.\n",
      "Yeah it has, 31 consecutive years that he has had at least one song in the hot 100. \n",
      "He is 100% talented. Even, his song \"Can you Feel the Love Tonight\" was part of the Lion King!\n",
      "Yeah I remember that being the big song in that movie, seems like so long ago. \n",
      "That song never gets old! Worth the Valentine's Day song! He had to campaign for it to be in the Lion King!\n",
      "That is very interesting, I know he played the piano, I don't think he played guitar though, do you know much about the guitar?\n",
      "I am a guitarist. I love playing my guitar. I only play when I am ready for open mic or recording music. \n",
      "That is very cool, that takes a lot of talent.  Are you a fan of Eddie Van Halen?\n",
      "I am not a fan, but I believe that he had a solo on \"beat it\"\n",
      "Yeah good call! I know he is known as being a really good guitarist as well. \n",
      "He burned the speakers. That is when you know he is pretty good in his music.\n",
      "Yeah that is pretty crazy, did you ever listen to any Pink Floyd?\n",
      "Maybe, I heard a few of the songs. He had some floating stage.\n",
      "Yeah its a band, I'm only really a fan of their first album but I guess the guitarist probably David Gilmour made a houseboat into a studio. \n",
      "That is an interesting setting. \n",
      "Yeah that would actually be very cool making music while floating down a river or something. \n",
      "It was nice chatting with you.\n",

      "Do you have liking for musicals like Aida?\n",
      "hi how are you? i do not know that musical. i do like musicals though.\n",
      "I can't say that I'm a big fan.  I did see a version of Cats once in London.\n",
      "that sounds like fun. i know that cats is a famous one. i have never seen it. i should go see it. i do not have the money though.\n",
      "I'd save your money, it was not that good.  I guess Elton John is involved in some of these musicals.\n",
      "EJ is a musical talent but i guess not everything is great. he is a dramatic type and very creative but perhaps he should stick to crocodile rockin'\n",
      "I think there is a movie coming out soon about him.  I know he was involved in that Lion King movie, doing its songs, its a musical now.\n",
      "elton has written great songs. i hope that he continues to write. i think that the lion king musical is not as good as the film. i would not see it.\n",
      "Do you play any musical instrument, piano or guitar possibly?\n",
      "I do not. I am terrible at the music. I would love to be able to play but I am not good at all. you?\n",
      "I too would like to play, had a go with a guitar a couple of times, but not very persistent.\n",
      "it is difficult to be a musician. it takes practice and time and talent and I do not have any of these. I think that the guitar is the coolest of all instruments, cooler than the oboe and bassoon.\n",
      "Yes, love love to be able to play music on a guitar, some Queen or Pink Floyd would be great.\n",
      "those are classic bands with great songs. if you could play those songs, you would get all kinds of friends. you would be a star on the guitar. what kind of costume would you wear though\n",
      "I'm fairly conservative when it comes to clothing.  I would certainly not wear what Elton John used to in the seventies.\n",
      "EJ was a trendsetter who stood out from the crowd. i could not wear his clothes in public. i would feel awkward. you would have to wear something to be a star though. maybe dress as a sunflower?\n",
      "He can wear what we wants, he's sold over 300 million records.  I doubt if he cares how people judge him.\n",
      "i guess he could wander about in the buff if he so chose. he has sold many records and his style is not the reason for that. he can be a free spirit. elton, wherever you are, fly free, you diva.\n",
      "Or a panda costume like those panda researchers wear.\n",
      "that would be so elton! he knows no boundaries. anyway, great chat! \n",
      "Have a good day.  Try to wear an interesting costume for the rest of the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey! I was thinking of seeing Elton John in concert.  Tickets are around $25-$55 bucks. does that sound reasonable? \n",
      "That is a good price for the man who sang \"Candle in the Wind 1997\"\n",
      "Especially since he has over 50 top 40 hits. I can't believe he has sold over 300 million records and I get to see him live!\n",
      "Good for you!     Seven consecutive number one albums is also an impressive record.\n",
      "No joke! I really hope his lyricist since 1967, Bernie Taupin, will be there!\n",
      "What is Elton John's real name?    I forget.\n",
      "His current name is Sir Elton Hercules John but he was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight! I didn't realize he changed so much about himself just to perform.\n",
      "True.    I wonder if he will change it back.     When was he born?    I know he is retiring from touring.\n",
      "He was born the 25 of march in 1947.  I did not realize how old he was! The songwriting partner I was talking about was born in 1967.  I also didn't know there was such an age difference. \n",
      "Interesting.     Which performer did Elton John help with in the 2013 Grammys?\n",
      "Ed Sheeran.  Even though I'm not a huge fan it was a great performance.  What do you love most about Elton?\n",
      "I like songs like \"Your Song\".    Can you believe it was originally written for 3 Dog Night!\n",
      "No way! I think that would ruin the song completely! Just like cutting the song \"Can you feel the love tonight\" from the Lion King would ruin that movie. They almost did cut it but it went on to win an Oscar for best original song.\n",
      "I enjoyed the Broadway version of the lion King.     Impressive Costumes!\n",
      "I agree! So thinking back to the concert I am mad that the show is only two and a half hours. I could stay their all night!\n",
      "Well, shows have to end sometime or the speakers might catch on fire like they did for Eddie Van Halen one time.\n",
      "He was recording the solo for \"beat it\" I believe. He is really great too.  I was incorrect about something I said earlier.  I stated that Bernie Taupin was born in 1967 but that is actually the date Elton and him became partners.  Sorry for the misinformation. \n",
      "No problem.    Some guitar players are really smart.     Brian may has a PhD in Astrophysics.\n",
      "I hear he uses coins as guitar picks as well.  That is just crazy! I wonder what other crazy things other guitarist have done!\n",
      "Well, Matthew Bellamy hold the Guinness world record for smashed guitars on a tour.\n",
      "I love Mr. Bellamy!  I like Pink Floyd also.  They turned a houseboat into a floating recording studio and called it the astoria. It is crazy what some musicians will do with for their music. \n",
      "True, but so do other professions.    Some panda researchers wear panda costumes to work!\n",
      "I guess that is just like the hoggie costume they used in labyrinth.  Well I am going to go get my tickets now it has been a pleasure talking to you!\n",
      "Later on.     Perhaps you can borrow Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow costume that he uses when he visits sick kids in hospitals!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you like and or listen to music?\n",
      "I do - I am a big Elton John Fan.  I love what he did with the Lion King\n",
      "Yeah that was cool. What other music do you like?\n",
      "I love his song Your Song - it was originally recorded by Three Dog Night\n",
      "Wow i did not know that elton john failed an audition. \n",
      "Yes apparently he is not good at writing lyrics.  Someone gave him some lyrics and ended up working for him\n",
      "Funny how the things in life lead us. Do you know what his break out hit was?\n",
      "It was Your Song in 1970\n",
      "Right i think i remember that song. I don't know much about his earlier work. \n",
      "He sold more than 300 million records and for 31 years he had a song in the top 100.  There is a lot of it!\n",
      "Wow he did all that in the 70's-00's that is some accomplishments. Did he play the guitar? \n",
      "No he just played the piano.  I am not sure where Matthew Bellamy played the guitar or just smashed them\n",
      "To funny!! You said he played in the lion king?\n",
      "Elton John wrote the music.  Bellamy was in the band muse and holds the guinness record for most guitars smashed!\n",
      "Never understood why they did that. The music he wrote in the lion king. Is that the one that say \"can you feel the love tonight?\n",
      "Yes.  The song was almost cut and he had to campaign for it to be left in.  It won an Oscar for best original song!\n",
      "Glad he pushed for it to be in. Do you know pink floyd?\n",
      "Yes I remember seeing on tv how their guitarist turned a houseboat on the Thames into a record studio\n",
      "Have you ever watched firefly apparently the costumes are left overs from Starship Troopers.\n",
      "Yes might as well recycle!  I want to be a panda researcher and get to dress up like a panda every day\n",
      "Wow this is so nice, Jonny depp travels with his Jack Sparrow costume just in case he makes a visit to a hospital to see sick kids.\n",
      "That is cool.  I cant believe that a costume from labyrinth was lost in shipping and now sits at the unclaimed baggage museum!\n",
      "That's to funny but i loved that movie and the costumes. Nice chatting with you.\n",
      "Yes there are great costumes!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you enjoy superhero movies? Did you see \"Wonder Woman\"? It is up for a best picture nomination.\n",
      "Yes, I do! I have not seen it yet, plan to soon! Did you? I heard it was up for nomination.\n",
      "Yes it is up for best picture Oscar. That is a first as superhero films are usually not in that category.\n",
      "Really, that interesting. I hope it wins!! Wonder woman is the highest grossing superhero origin movie!\n",
      "It made lots of money, so it was a winner in that respect, maybe it will will prove to be a winner in the awards too.  There was another superhero movie that did well in 2017, so I hope that \"Logan\" doesn't take away from some of the credit WW might get otherwise.\n",
      "That's right!  Did you know Gal Godot served 2 years as a soldier?\n",
      "I wonder if being a soldier helped prepare for taking part in a superhero movie.\n",
      "I bet it helped her get in shape for sure! Do you enjoy the Batman movies? Who is your favorite Batman?\n",
      "I have seen some of the original DC comics, and like the fact that he has no superpowers, so anyone could become like Batman.\n",
      "That's true. I loved the batman movies. I also like cat woman!! There is over 300 registered superheros in the US.\n",
      "Superheros are fun, but the villains are fun too. My favorite villain is \"Condiment King\"\n",
      "lol, Funny! I don't know him? He's into ketchup and such? There is a superhero named Normal-man. On a planet of superheros with superpowers, he's the only one without.\n",
      "Being the only normal one would be depressing, I would keep trying to find out what my power was.  The Condiment King slipped on his own ketchup and was defeated by Batman.\n",
      "lol, really!! ha, ha. There is also a superhero for the hearing impaired!\n",
      "Who fights him? I know some of the villains like Joker against Batman, but never HEARD of a deaf one.\n",
      "I can't remember his name something ear. It was a little boy that became a superhero. Will have to look that one up! But, I remember thinking it was great for children that can't hear. \n",
      "I suppose there is a superhero for everyone with over 300 of them. Sometimes though they cause damage.  There is even a series about fixing the problems they cause.\n",
      "Yes, I heard that. I think one of my favorites is Garfield and the gang!  The Pet Force! lol Good chat!!\n",
      "Garfield would make a funny superhero. Good talking to you.\n",
      "I agree, he makes me laugh just looking at him!! Very cool!! You too! \n",
      "I look forward to watching the Oscars and seeing what super hero movies win in each catagory. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a superhero movie fan?\n",
      "Yes I do like superhero movies I specially like Groot, what do you think about him?\n",
      "I love Groot even though he only says 3 words!\n",
      "Yep I agree with you. Did you ever see the superhero movie Thor by the way? It came out in 2011\n",
      "I did, I wasn't too much of a fan, i liked the new thor. What did you think of it\n",
      "Yeah I like the newest one, Thor Ragnarok the best, I only thought the first one was ok, interesting was directed by Kenneth Branagh\n",
      "It was so good, it set the mood for the avengers movie. Apparently tom hiddleston auditioned for thor but  got loki instead\n",
      "That is pretty interesting. What do you think about Ant-Man? Apparently he made his debut before Spider-Man, The Hulk, Thor, or even Iron Man\n",
      "I didn't know that. They were good movies, a different kind of superhero\n",
      "What's crazy though is that 80% of the dialogue in Thor Ragnarok was actually improvised, maybe thats why I liked it\n",
      "wow, i did not know that! I don't like that disney owns the rights to marvel now\n",
      "I don't like that either. It seems like they have too much that they own now. They even own Star Wars!\n",
      "Right, talk about a monopoly. They are taking everything marvel and disney off netflix which is all i watch basically!\n",
      "Haha you're right about that. Do you think that Sony was dumb for not buying all of Marvel's properties when they had the chance?\n",
      "man they are so not smart! I tell you what though, Iron man was so good when it came out in 2008\n",
      "Yep that was one of my favorite Marvel movies actually, it's crazy that the person who played Ralphie in\"A Christmas Story\"was the executive producer of that movie lol\n",
      "I remember watching it in theatres. I did not know that lol I dont know how I feel now about that!\n",
      "Yeah it's pretty crazy haha. What do you think about the fact that Iron Man was filmed without a script? It was mostly made up on the spot which is crazy\n",
      "wow, that takes a smart person to be honest. Stan lee created iron man because he thought no one would like him.\n",
      "Yeah I don't know how he came up with that. Iron Man is easily one of the best characters LOL. I love Robert Downey jr. In the role\n",
      "for sure, he is the best for it. Good chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey did you know that superheroes got their start back in the 1930s?\n",
      "I did not! Do you think Gal Gadot will get an oscar?\n",
      "I don't know.  I heard she served two years as a soldier in the Israel defense forces in real life.\n",
      "I heard that too. I think they have too in other countries. You may not get a choice. The critics are saying wonder woamn is setting the bar pretty high for superhero films. Have you seen it?\n",
      "I haven't seen it yet.  I don't think a superhero movie has every won an academy award though.\n",
      "I'm surprised by that! I would have thought the Dark Knight would have won. Especially with Kurt Cobain in it.\n",
      "Yeah, none of them have ever been nominated for a best picture, even that one.\n",
      "Thats crazy. I haven't seen Birdman either, The one they made of off Micheal Keaton's Batman. Have you seen it?\n",
      "No, but I did see him in Batman and he was fantastic. Have you seen Logan?  Word is that movie could be popular with the academy.\n",
      "I haven't/ Don't go to the movies much. Will have to wait for netflix. I got it wrong, It wasn't Kurt Cobain, it was Keith Ledger! Have you seen Logan?\n",
      "Not yet, but I have seen Xmen and I liked Wolverine. I think Hugh Jackman plays that really well.  I heard that the movie has some old Western quotes in it.\n",
      "That will be fun. I really like Hugh Jackman too. Great Actor. I like how they take off from other genres.\n",
      "I do too.  I know Wonder Woman has a female director so that might help it get some votes.\n",
      "Thats awesome! There are so few female directors! \n",
      "I know and this one is the most money making ever by one.\n",
      "There was a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes. What a great idea!\n",
      "That would be really cool!  I heard something recently that is really hard to believe. I heard there are actually over 300 registered super heroes in the country.\n",
      "Isn't that wild! I also heard that Stan lee wrote 15 dc comics!\n",
      "Here's some weird trivia for you.  Adam West has the batman logo on one of his teeth.\n",
      "What? How? There was a garfield book series spinoff named pet force which featured garfield and gang as superheroes\n",
      "I didn't know that! Garfield as a superhero could be fun to watch.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi do you like superhero movies?\n",
      "Yes, I do like superhero movies. Do you like Marvel?\n",
      "Yes they have amazing movies. Did you see Thor?\n",
      "Yes I really liked that movie. Have you seen the Avegners: Infinity War?\n",
      "I have actually I like them both. Did you know Antman made his debut in Thor?\n",
      "That is cool. Did you know Michael Jackson tried to buy Marvel comics in the 1990\n",
      "Did not know that but I know that they offers to sell the rights to the characters to Sony and they only bough spiderman.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is interesting. Marvel also published a generic comic named super-hero and super-villain before.\n",
      "Hmm interesting. Have you heard of the superhero Access?\n",
      "I have not heard of that before. Do you like the 2008 film of Iron Man?\n",
      "Yeah it was good too. The guy who player Ralphie in a Christmas story was the producer of it\n",
      "\n",
      "In the beginning, the people who took tony stark reveal the whole plot of the movie in the language of Urdu\n",
      "Wow nice. The first movie was also filmed without a scripts, pretty cool huh?\n",
      "Thats very cool. Did you know the richest superhero is black panther?\n",
      "Nice, did now know that, thought maybe Tony Stark was, he seems to have a lot of money\n",
      "Yeah black panther has an estimated worth of $500 billion! That is a lot of money\n",
      "Wow that sure is. The guy who did the voice of Jarvis has never seen the movies\n",
      "Wow, Jarvis also stands for just a rather very intelligent system\n",
      "yeah and it is voiced by Paul Bettany. Do you know why Stan Lee created Iron-Man?\n",
      "I did know that. Did you know the spaceships in Thor are named after old Australian cars?\n",
      "Haha that is so cool, did not know that. The actor that plays Loki originally auditioned for the role of Thor\n",
      "Awesome. Odin's ravens in thor also appear in the avengers film too\n",
      "Nice, there is so much overlap with these movies\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you watch any of the Marvel movies? They are some of my favorites\n",
      "I love Marvel movies. I really like the first Iron Man. I'm super impressed that Robert Downey Jr. improvised it all.\n",
      "There wasn't even a script! No wonder it was such a great movie! He only made $500K for that first movie, too!\n",
      "yeah, I read he made 10 million for the second one.\n",
      "Sometimes it pays to stick around for the sequel. The person who does the voice of Jarvis has never actually watched the movies\n",
      "wow, that's crazy. Stan Lee created Iron Man because he didn't think anyone would like him. I guess you never know what's going to happen\n",
      "He's the kind of guy that we love to hate. Stan Lee is a genius though for creating all the heroes that he has\n",
      "Did you hear that Disney doesn't own the rights to big marvel characters in theme parks easta of the Mississippi?\n",
      "Isn't that due to a deal they made with Universal Studios? Some of the rides at their park are based off Marvel characters, and that would be hard to move\n",
      "yeah, I guess it was because of a deal they signed with Universal Studios in the 90s\n",
      "But they could utilize the Marvel characters west of the Mississippi if they wanted. Both Marvel and DC both own one character for the sole purpose of keeping the universes separate\n",
      "yeah, I heard his name is access. Funny name considering what he is used for.\n",
      "Very true. I wonder if that was a name that Stan Lee came up with. He did create one called Blue Ear just for a 4 year old who needed hearing aids\n",
      "I don't know, these contract deals are always so weird. Apparently fox didn't think Marvel was worth 25 million, so they only bought Spiderman for 10 million\n",
      "They did make two version of him in the time they had the rights, and now they've made a deal with Marvel. They definitely didn't see that outcome\n",
      "Did you hear Marvel successfully argued in court that mutants are not people? It goes against the whole idea behind the X-Men\n",
      "I'm surprised the judge went for that one, but maybe they were unfamiliar with the movies. That's a strange argument to get a lower rate than that for dolls\n",
      "I mean they are toys, and not dolls. So I sorta agree.\n",
      "I guess it depends on your perspective. Like, I wonder why Thor got his first movie before AntMan when AntMan was created first\n",
      "Because Thor is more popular.\n",
      "Did they make that decision based on comic books sales. Sometimes I wonder what the deciding factors are\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello there, did you see the Iron Man movie?\n",
      "I saw that in theatres years ago, it got me loving marvel movies, how about you?\n",
      "I actually never saw the movie for some reason, but heard that Tony Stark has a lot of money. \n",
      "I heard he is worth 100 billion in the films\n",
      "That is crazy, and the real Robert Downey only made 500,000 for the first one but then 10 mill for the 2nd!\n",
      "Man, that was a big pay increase lol. I didn't like Iron man 2 too much \n",
      "Yeah that is a crazy pay raise from one to the next!  I didn't realize the first film did so well. \n",
      "For sure, I just remember leaving the theatres thinking what an awesome movie! Who would have guessed what was to come after that. Do you know Paul Bettany?\n",
      "I think he did some of the voices in the movies right?\n",
      "He was jarvis in those movies. Apparently he never watched them lol\n",
      "Lol that is hilarious!  I don't know how you wouldn't want to see the final product you have been working on. \n",
      "Right, maybe he was made mad he was just a voice\n",
      "Lol, well i'm sure he wasn't mad when he got his paycheck for just being a voice. \n",
      "For sure, that is the perfect job for me. Shy on camera but can talk on the radio if I needed to lol\n",
      "Yeah I wouldn't mind just being a voice, I always wanted to work for my local radio station lol. \n",
      "Me too, lol. I don't think it pays much. Do you like Marvel comics in general?\n",
      "Yeah I used to read quite a bit when I was younger, how about you?\n",
      "Me too, who was your favorite character?\n",
      "I would say Wolverine for sure, how about you?\n",
      "Great choice, I would say the xmen in general I loved growing up. I like deadpool now, those were great movies and comics!\n",
      "Yeah I liked that Deadpool was rated R lol.  Anyways, it's been nice chatting with you, I hope you have a good day!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, do you like any of the Superhero films?\n",
      "Yes I enjoy many of them. Which one is your favorite?\n",
      "It's hard to choose one, I really like the Captain America and the Iron Man movies, how about you?\n",
      "While my favorite is Hulk, I did really like the Captain America movie. It's the best of both worlds because he meets up with Tony Stark.\n",
      "Yes true. Thor is pretty good as well, the hulk was seen as an immense green symbol of kinship to Thor in the movie.\n",
      "I really enjoyed the relationship that Thor and Hulk had in Thor: Ragnarok. I really think they worked well together? If they had to square up and fight who do you think would have the upper hand?\n",
      "That's a tough question....I would have to say Hulk only because he has seniority on Thor I think...lol!\n",
      "Yeah that would be an epic batter. I wonder where Marvel got all there inspiration for these characters. I know Marvel has been around since 1939 but when Disney took over they really started making excellent films.\n",
      "Yes, the creativity in the characters is really great, it would be fun to find out what or who inspired each character. I didn't know that Marvel had been around since 1939.\n",
      "Yeah they really started to take off when Stan Lee and Jack Kirby started to create. They made the Fantastic Four also.\n",
      "Oh that's another great one! I see that Iron Man is the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n",
      "Yes. Iron Man was wildly popular. Do you think it was such a hit because of the character of Iron Man himself or because of the acting of Robert Downey Jr.?\n",
      "You know, I was just wondering that also, I think Robert Downey Jr is the perfect actor for the part, I couldn't imagine anyone else. I would have to say it's because of him in this particular part. What do you think?\n",
      "I think his acting was great but I also think that Iron Man himself draws in a crowd. His costume just looks so great. I have younger kids myself and we enjoy watching it together. I think that other actors could have done equally well. Of all the costumes and weapons, what would be your favorite of the characters?\n",
      "Oh wow, I couldn't choose just one.  His costume stands out to me, so I would choose it.\n",
      "Right. For me I am intrigued by the hammer from Thor. I wish I had that thing to swing around at my will. I enjoyed watching him use it while teaming up with Hulk. \n",
      "Ha ha, true!  I also like how the Avengers learn how to cast aside individual egos and put their strengths together for greater good.\n",
      "Yeah to me the Avengers shows a power struggle on which superhero will be the leader. I think that Iron Man takes the cake. Throughout the conversation we did not bring up perhaps the most famous superhero of the Marvel bunch, none other that Spider-Man\n",
      "I was just thinking the same thing, When you asked me about costumes, he came to mind.  I really do like Spiderman as well.\n",
      "Me too, the homecoming series has been my favorite of the bunch. I would love to see a Peter Parker and Tony Stark movie where they both are unaware of their special powers. \n",
      "That's a great idea for a movie storyline!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi. Do you watch superhero movies?\n",
      "I do! I just watched avengers the other day! Have you seen Wonder Woman?\n",
      "I haven't, but I should! It was the highest grossing superhero movie!\n",
      "I know! I've seen the Dark Knight too, have you? It was the highest before Wonder Woman.\n",
      "I did. I didn't realize Batman's character was created in 1939!\n",
      "He's been around a long time. Did you see Logan? I haven't yet.\n",
      "I haven't seen that either. There are a lot of superheros to keep up with! About 300 in the US\n",
      "There are a lot! Gal Gadot won a critics choice award for Wonder Woman!\n",
      "She thought she was auditioning for catwoman when she tried out for that role.\n",
      "Thats crazy! That would be odd to do. I did not know this! There was a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes\n",
      "There is also a superhero called normalman who has no superpowers. Haha. \n",
      "Hm! I wonder what he does? Just call himself a superhero? :)\n",
      "I think so! He's the only one without superpowers on a planet of superheroes. \n",
      "That's fun! Stan lee wrote 15 DC comics! He was in the Avengers movie I just watched too!\n",
      "Very cool! Apparently Gotham City is in New Jersey. Who knew!\n",
      "I wonder if that was where they filmed too? Not only is wonder woman the highest-grossing superhero origin movie, it is also the highest-grossing wwi movie\n",
      "I'm not sure! That's interesting. Gal Gadot was a soldier in the Israel Defense Forces!\n",
      "I had no idea! This is cool..With (star wars: the last jedi, beauty and the beast, wonder woman) 2017 was the first year since 1958 (south pacific, auntie mame, cat on a hot tin roof) that the top 3 highest grossing domestic films were female led.\n",
      "That's a long time! Wonder Woman was in Dawn of Justice the year before Wonder Woman the movie came out.\n",
      "Omg! did you see this? There was a batman villain named condiment king and he was defeated by slipping on his own ketchup!\n",
      "Too funny! I learned a lot about superheros! Thanks for chatting. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi, do you like superhero movies?\n",
      "Yes. Of course! I guess Wonder Woman is the newest favorite.\n",
      "i loved the movie. did you watch it?\n",
      "No, but I guess I better watch the DVD. Is it time for woman's equality among the superheroes?\n",
      "yeah. it was the highest grossing superhero origin movie?\n",
      "Wow. Isn't it interesting that none of the superhero movies were every nominated for the best picture at the Oscars.\n",
      "yeah that is strange. do you know who plays wonder woman?\n",
      "Gal Gadot. I really don't recognize her, since I didn't see the movie and I don't remember her in other films. i guess The Dark Knight was was expected to be nominated in 2008, and it wasn't\n",
      "yeah that is her. she served in israeli defence forces\n",
      "She's very involved in the Me Too Movement. So maybe Wonder Woman is in a good position for awards.\n",
      "yeah there you go. she did not even know she was auditioning for the movie\n",
      "Really? Huh. That's interesting. It's hard to imagine that the superhero comic books go back to the 1930s.\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah that is a long time. do you like batman?\n",
      "Yes. I even remember the Batman TV show. Ha. I love the fantastic four and the avengers. The group stories are always good.\n",
      "yes much better than the individual superhero movies\n",
      "Did you know that there are around 30 superhero movies coming out from 2016-2020\n",
      "that is amazing,. have you heard of the batman villain called condiment king\n",
      "No. Tell me more.\n",
      "well, he apparently was defeated by slipping on his own ketchup\n",
      "Oh, that's lame!!! ;) Well, Mr. Stan Lee sure came up with a great creation when he created these stories.\n",
      "yeah, too bad he is no longer around. nice chat\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, have you watched jurassic park fallen kingdom?\n",
      "I have! It was great! The huge amount of dragonflies last summer reminded me of that movie lol\n",
      "lol It was a great movie!  Did you know dinosaurs in the movie only appear for 15 min .\n",
      "Really? That is interesting! Also fun fact....Jurassic park were the reason McDonald's super sized their meals....dino sized!\n",
      "Oh wow i didnt know that,  thats cool lol I didnt know the raptors in the movie had humans inside suits lol\n",
      "They did? Wow, I thought it was all camera magic lol! I also loved Jurassic World and couldn't wait for this one to come out\n",
      "It took 6 hours to render one frame of the rain soaked t rex in jurassic park!  Good thing that first movie made a ton of money lol\n",
      "Whoa, that's crazy! Yes, they are not in need of any money for sure! Funny too how they use an elephant roar to depict the t rex roar.\n",
      "Oh wow,  thats cool,  never even made the connection lol \n",
      "Exactly, thought that was interesting! So do you like fish? I had a gold fish for awhile and I heard the oldest goldfish lived to be 43 years old! \n",
      "I do like fish!  My favorite sea animal is the orca.  That is really long for a goldfish.  \n",
      "Right? I read that a koi fish once lived for 226 years, its name was Hanako. Amazing!  Sometimes I think insects live that long too haha...\n",
      "That is interesting!  There is a type of jellyfish and lobster that is immortal\n",
      "That's odd! I find that interesting! Speaking of insects, I love Dragonflies! Some species can fly for 5,000 miles without stopping, so awesome!\n",
      "Thats impressive!  Kinda like birds migrating,  they dont sleep or stop either lol\n",
      "But dragonflies only live a few weeks, maybe a year if lucky! They have to fly fast. Dragonflies during mating form a shape of a heart, that's interesting! There are more than 5,000 species of Dragonflies as well, they all eat insects so that's good lol\n",
      "yes,  that is awesome.  Did you know tiny red bugs found in concrete are called clover mites?\n",
      "No I did not know that, those little pesky insects! Lol, I am just happy there are a lot of other insects that eat insects, there are too many! \n",
      "Anytime you see ingredients that contain carmine,  cochineal extract or natural red 4.... the product contains crushed bugs!\n",
      "Ew!!! No way! I am not eating those ingredients any longer lol, yuck! I will stick too all natural foods like fish and veggies lol\n",
      "Same here,  I am going to be looking at ingredients all the time now!  Who thought it was a good idea to use crushed bugs in our food and why did it get approved, ugh\n",
      "Blah! I agree! Insects have no place in my life or belly haha! \n",
      "Unless,  Im in the dessert and its a survival thing lol then I'd eat all the bugs lol \n",
      "I would probably just die ...I have the shivers as we speak, phobia about insects lol...\n",
      "Yeah its disgusting for sure,  but if its life or death I'll do it,  this is why I always have soy sauce packets in my car....if its life or death at least I can coat it with soy sauce lol Its been excellent chatting with you,  thank you very much. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "I am well. Thank you. Did you happen to see Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom?\n",
      "I did not. I only saw the first chris pratt one. Did you see it?\n",
      "Yes I saw both. In Fallen Kingdom the dinosaurs actually only appear on screen for 15 minutes. \n",
      "Wow, that is not a lot of time. I would have thought it was longer. I wonder if they had a small CGI budget.\n",
      "I'm not sure about the CG budget bu the movie budget was $63 million. Surprisingly, the Jurassic Park ride cost more to make at $110 million. \n",
      "Pratt joked with Spielberg about giving him the part in 2010. Foreshadowing????\n",
      "Wow! That's very funny that he would later end up in it then. They were huge parts for him too. \n",
      "Yeah. He was ripped in the movies too. He did not look like andy dwyer from Parks and Rec, that's for sure.\n",
      "No he did not. I watched that first also and was shocked when he became an action star. Did you know that one frame of the rain soaked T-Rex takes six hours to render? That's an insane amount of work. \n",
      "The raptors had humans inside of the suits? That seems more archeaic than I would have thought.\n",
      "Really?! I assumed they were entirely CG. I have to imagine that they at least used some CG over the practical. \n",
      "I would think so. Did you ever read the Crichton book Jussaric Park?\n",
      "I did not. It was everywhere when I was a kid and it seemed like everyone was but I just never got around to it. \n",
      "It's one of the reasons I never saw the original. I loved the book so much I didn't want to taint my love of it by some crappy movine.\n",
      "That makes sense. It's always harder after the book. Are you at all interested in fish?\n",
      "I am. Are you?\n",
      "I do find them interesting. Did you know that there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal? I hope we are studying why.\n",
      "I feel like that needs to be studied more! I want to live longer, maybe not immortal but maybe until I am 150...\n",
      "I absolutely agree. I would love to know what makes that possible. Another interesting fact is that the seahorse is the only fish with a neck. \n",
      "Nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It sure has been raining a lot lately, I wonder if thats the reason of the increase on Dragonflies\n",
      "It seem so. Since there is more rain, there are more mosquitos for the dragonflies to feast on.\n",
      "I so they feast on mosquitos, thank dragonflies then lol, I just hate mosquitos, although dragonflies are kind of scary\n",
      "Apparently a dragonfly can eat 30 mosquitos a day. Like you said, thank you dragonflies! I didn't realize dragonflies were such predators. All their wings allow them fly better than their prey.\n",
      "I think its interesting how dragonflies form a closed circle in a shape of a heart when they are mating\n",
      "I can't really imagine how that works. Who knew dragonflies were so romantic? I guess when you only live for less than a year you make the most of your life.\n",
      "I guess so lol, they sure are taking advantage of their time on earth, insects are interesting, have you ever eaten something with carmine or cachineal extract in it?\n",
      "Maybe? I'm not even sure what that is. \n",
      "Well its an ingredient found on some food and on the red 4 colorant, when you see a label with any of those ingredient beware as you are eating crushed up bugs.\n",
      "What? Really? I did not know that! I have heard of bugs being used to color nail polish and other cosmetics, but I was unaware it was in food. I don't know what to think about that. Do I remain oblivious or research it more?\n",
      "Maybe oblivious as you might be surprise, I would rather remain in ignorance lol, there is a species of insects called gold bugs.\n",
      "Are gold bugs like beetles or flying bugs? I don't like bugs that fly. Just like you said dragonflies are scary. They move fast an come out of nowhere. \n",
      "I think they are totally different, their real name is extremophiles they breath dissolve gold and excrete it in a solid form\n",
      "Oh my gosh, you are a wealth of knowledge. I love it\n",
      "Bugs sure are interesting, to think they can be found in almost every environment!\n",
      "I imagine that there is a vast amount of species of insects and bugs. I never would've realized that there are even bugs in the ocean. \n",
      "Apparently there are, did you know that 90% of all animals on earth are actually insects, no wonder why my place is full with mosquitos.\n",
      "You need to get you some dragonflies to deal with those mosquitoes. Where I live sand gnats are a huge issue, but I never see any dragonflies helping me out. I guess you would need a source of water nearby to be able to host the dragonfly nymphs before they hatch.\n",
      "I think I will do that, hopefully it works if now I will have two problems instead of one lol!\n",
      ":) haha, find out who the dragonfly's predator is so you have a backup plan just in case they get out of hand.\n",
      "If that doesn't work either I will be in serious trouble then lol I might end up with a zoo at my home and mosquitos would still bite me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey, did you know there is a species of fish that is immortal? How cool is that? \n",
      "Really? Where is this species found?\n",
      "Im not 100% but i believe not too far from Japan. \n",
      "Are dolphins considered fish?\n",
      "No i dont think so as they are mammals and not fish. \n",
      "What about octopus what are they considered?\n",
      "They would be closer to a clam or mullosk. Again not 100% but i think different than fish. \n",
      "Do you know which insect happens to be the first non-human meat farmers?\n",
      "No, i dont! Which insect? \n",
      "It was an african breed of ants.\n",
      "Thats so wild! I did just find out that if you are eating/drinking something with natural red 4 it has bugs in it. \n",
      "Omg, that probably means my red velvet cake might have a little bit of bugs in it lol\n",
      "Totally! Did you know that seahorses are the only fish to have a neck? \n",
      "Now that i think about it those are the only fish you see with actual necks, do you know which fish it is that has a head that is transparent?\n",
      "Yeah, once i thought about it it seemed obvious. No which? \n",
      "I'm pretty sure they're called barreleye fish, they never really mentioned any of the more unique ones when I was watching spongebob as a kid\n",
      "interesting. Do you know if there is a fish with 2 hearts? \n",
      "No lol i know there's cows with 3 stomachs, but 2 hearts is something else, what is the fish called?\n",
      "I dont know. There is a beer called 2 hearted ale with a big fish on it so i always wondered. \n",
      "Do you know which fish is composed of mostly water actually 98 percent of it to be exact?\n",
      "I dont. have a great day! \n",
      "Thank you my friend it was great\n",
      "\n",

      "Good Morning.  Putting on my polo shirt which ironically was invented for tennis.\n",
      "Who invented the shirt? \n",
      "Rene \"the crocodile\" lacoste was the inventor.\n",
      "Oh, this is the famous Izod shirt? I guess there is also Polo shirts, which are worn mostly by people not playing polo. The Hawaiians have the right idea about office attire.\n",
      "For sure.  I'd rather wear the aloha shirt than a suit and tie any day.\n",
      "In the UK, they call them trousers, but we in the US call them \"pants.\" \n",
      "Some cities actually have laws prohibiting \"saggy pants'\n",
      "I think it's a sloppy look, and probably a bit too revealing for some folks. I laughed when I saw that a D.C. judged sued a dry cleaner for millions over a lost pair of pants. I wonder whether it was for pain and suffering.\n",
      "Year, $67 million to be exact.  That's crazy.  He should have been fined for such a frivolous lawsuit like that.  \n",
      "It's an abuse of judicial power, even if the judge hired a lawyer. I would expect a judge to throw out suits like that, since they clogs up the system.\n",
      "I agree completely.  I wonder what his pants looked like.  Now if they were Aladdin's pants which were modeled after mc hammer's pants, maybe they would be worth 67 million.\n",
      "I honestly expected MC Hammer's pants to be modeled after Aladdin's. It seems strange that the Romans thought pants were barbaric. I wonder why pants seem uncivilized.\n",
      "Not sure, but apparently pants were originally worn by mounted armies on horseback.\n",
      "I wonder how the Romans felt about socks, especially with the sandals that they wore. \n",
      "I bet if got cold though they could do like the japanese and put chile peppers in the socks to keep their toes warm.\n",
      "That would make for some interesting smelling feet. I didn't know that socks were originally designed to be worn with sandals. Nowadays the look is considered a goofy dad look.\n",
      "Yeah, I only do that if I'm running out to get the mail or something.\n",
      "The foot produces a lot of sweat, so the socks help absorb it. Maybe if a celebrity made the look popular, it would be acceptable generally.\n",
      "Probably so.  Like if Billy mays work them with his blue shirts and khaki pants, that might have worked.\n",
      "Who is Billy Mays?\n",
      "He was the informercial guy, sold Oxy Clean for years.\n",
      "I've never heard of him. Did he always wear blue shirts and khaki pants?\n",
      "That was his thing.  Well, it's been nice chatting with you this morning.\n",
      "Nice chatting! Bye\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you have a favorite style of shirt?\n",
      "I like t shirts.  I don't care for dress shirts, or shirts that hav a vertical opening with buttons.\n",
      "Do you have a favorite brand or designer?\n",
      "not necessarily.  I guess if i had to choose it would be Nike or Under Armour.  I wonder if they could wear them in Hawaii where they get to wear aloha shirts to work instead of suit and tie.\n",
      "I like under armour too. The have great moisture wicking shirts\n",
      "That wouldn't work too well in China during the cultural revolution where they layered as many shirts as possible.\n",
      "Do you believe we should buy shirts and clothes from China?\n",
      "I have no problem with it.  Restricting trade between China and US would only hurt US consumers.  I wonder if they ban \"saggy pants\" in China like they do in Collinsville?\n",
      "Saggy pants and skinny jeans should be banned everywhere\n",
      "That's funny.  What else is funny is that a judge in D.C once sued a dry cleaner for losing a pair of his pants.\n",
      "Wow. The chinese like to dress in layers and started the \"pop you collar\" craze.\n",
      "I heard that.  Funny how fads start.  The tomans actually though wearing pants were a sign of barbarism.\n",
      "It was only recently were Congresswoman allowed to wear skirts on the house or Senate floor\n",
      "I know.  That doesn't sound right.  Should have been like that long before.  That judge that i spoke of earlier sued for 67 million for lost pants.  That's crazy.\n",
      "Did he win his case? Seem like a lot of money to sue for over pants.\n",
      "I imagine not.  No judge should have been allowed to do that.  It is a totally frivolous lawsuit.\n",
      "For sure, if anybody should know that it would be him.\n",
      "It's not like the dry cleaner lost MC Hammer's iconic pants.  Those were actually what the creators of Aladdin used as a model for his pants.\n",
      "Maybe that is why they sued for so much because of how valuable they were\n",
      "Possibly.  Well, it's been nice chatting with you.\n",
      "You as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, are you into fashion clothing?\n",
      "Yes. I do like Ralph Lauren.You, know polo shirts were originally invented for tennis by famous player Rene Lacoste.\n",
      "Ahh.  Makes sense now.  In England, a shirt is defined as a shirt with a collar.\n",
      "Ok. Did not know that. Yes the official business and office attire in Hawaii is aloha shirt instead of a suit and tie.\n",
      "Oh wow..that is awesome!  In china, gangsters wore as many shirts as they could!\n",
      "That is interesting. Did you know that socks are among the most needed items at homeless shelter, yet among the least -often donated.\n",
      "Yes, in fact Amazon had a video where homeless someone would ask homeless what they needed and they said socks, then a couple hours later it was delivered!\n",
      "That is nice. Did you know that Collinsville, has a law that prohibits 'saggy pants\", weird?\n",
      "They had that in my school.  Did you know the romans viewed pants as barbaric?\n",
      "Yes. Speaking about it, Alladin's pants were modeled after MC Hammer.\n",
      "Wow, you would think it was the other way around.  The brits call them trousers\n",
      "I know, and a d.c. judge sued a small dry cleaning business for over $67 million for the loss of a pair of pants.\n",
      "The oldest surviving pair of socks ever found was designed to wear with sandals\n",
      "You know with all the drama that was said In the end, all that matters is doing whats best for my client. That is how bussiness works.\n",
      "Oh the realtor who used semi nude models?  Thats crazy for a house that was valued at 230k\n",
      "Yes, I know. That was a good business move. Gyldenege, the realtor, found 100 complaints. Crazy?\n",
      "That meant 10000 people saw the ad he said.\n",
      "Yes, a win-win. And it took only 40 days after it was listed to get those views. Good  innovative idea.\n",
      "Other realtors gave tacos or wore panda suits!\n",
      "Right? And it took Kristin Gyldenege, the realtor, only 24 hours after she posted images from the risque photo shoot, for 20,000 people to click on the listing. Successes.\n",
      "Crazy.  Take care.\n",
      "Thank you. You too.\n",
      ":)\n",
      "Enjoy your day.\n",
      "You do the same.\n",
      "Yes. Thank you.\n",
      "Good Night\n",

      "\n",
      "Do you know who published the comic Black Panther is based on?\n",
      "I do not.\n",
      "OK.     I know it is part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, so would guess it was Marvel.\n",
      "Yeah. Have you seen black panther?\n",
      "Yes, I really like director Ryan Coogler.\n",
      "I thought the movie was really well done. It exceeded my expectations.\n",
      "I also really enjoy stars Michael B. Jordan and Chadwick Boseman.\n",
      "They did a great job in that movie. I thought Michael D Jordan did really well as I do not normally like him. Boseman was awesome!\n",
      "I was surprised to hear that Black Panther is actually the richest superhero.    Always thought that was Batman.\n",
      "It's that vibranium money! I would take either amount though...\n",
      "Speaking of Chadwick Boseman, did you know he has a past with Denzel Washington!\n",
      "I did not know that... Do you know how?\n",
      "Denzel paid for Boseman to go to an Oxford theater program, then they met at the premiere of Black Panther.\n",
      "Wow, that's crazy. Did you see Wonder Woman?\n",
      "I did.    I find it amazing that the flick is the highest grossing WWI movie!\n",
      "Yeah! She debut as the Justice SOciety's secretary! How sexist...\n",
      "True, but that was way back in 1941!    Did you know Gal Godot was actually in the Israel Defense forces?\n",
      "I heard that. I think she was perfectly cast in that movie. Anyone bigger would have taken away from the movie.\n",
      "Can you imagine Meryl Streep - even a younger one in that role?\n",
      "I am not sure I could see her in that role. I see her as to regal now... Am I right in thinking that?\n",
      "Perhaps, although her first film role was in a sports movie.\n",
      "I did not know that. Nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you seen the Black Panther movie?\n",
      "NO I have not see it yet but I really want to. I know its an all African American cast and historic in that way.\n",
      "Yes. It was pretty good.  I won't share any movie revealing details then if you haven't see it.  The Blank Panthers has an estimated $500 billion dollars and is the richest superhero.\n",
      "Wow. I know it's the richest superhero in history too. The Marvel Comics character black panther was not named after the Black Panther Party. Which I just learned.\n",
      "That's correct.  The symbols and written script from the movie are based on an acutal script called nsibdi.\n",
      "Amazing, I love when things are historical in a movie because it makes it more believable. Chadwick Boseman was accepted in to a prestigious summer theater program at Oxford University but couldn't afford it.\n",
      "I see that he secured funding through a private benefactor who turned out to be Denzel Washington!\n",
      "Oh wow, noway! I didn't know that part of the story. How cool would that be! Washington made a good investment in the guy who turned out Black Panther,wow.\n",
      "Yes!  and over 20 years later Chadwick thanked him in person at the premiere of Black Panther.  Did you see the Wonder Woman movie?\n",
      "SO cool. Yes, I love Wonder Woman. The actress who plays her Gal Gadot didn't even know that she was auditioning for Wonder Woman at the time she was doing it. \n",
      "Yes.  I found it interesting that she served 2 years as a soldier in the Israel defense forces so she kind of had exprerience for the role.\n",
      "That's an amazing personal history not many people have, really incredible. Gal Gadot thought that day she auditioned that she was trying for Catwoman. That is sort of funny. SHes just that good.\n",
      "That is funny!  Wonder Woman is both the highest grossing superhero origin movie and the highest WW1 movie too!\n",
      "Neat! I never heard that fact before. I am also a huge Meryl Streep fan. Her first film was a sports film which seems like an odd fit but she made it work, I guess.\n",
      "I've always liked her!  She auditioned for the lead role in the 1976 King Kong movie.  The producer said she was ugly.  What an insult!\n",
      "Oh yeah and the funny part of that story is that she speaks Italian fluently! So she responded to his insult in his own language.lol \n",
      "Right!  lol  She has been nominated for an Academy Awawrd 18 times!\n",
      "Yes, she has received 31 Golden GLobe nominations , winning eight- more nominations and wins than any other actor.\n",
      "Yjsy\n",
      "Meryl Streep's daughter is also an actress. She plays the fbi agent on Mr. Robot, Grace Bummer. That's a good legacy.\n",
      "Sorry I hit the enter button by accident.  I didn't know that.  How interesting.  I seen where Stanly Tucci make Meryl cook with him to prepare for Julie & Julia.  Neat.\n",
      "Yes, they cooked together to really get into character. I bet that food was incredible to snack on during the making of the film! \n",
      "I would have been hungry all the time smelling that on the set!  lol  I have to get running.  It was nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Have you watched Black Panther?\n",
      "I haven't seen it yet, but I bought it to watch when I have free time. I tend to take forever to get around to seeing movies, even though I've read critics' opinions. You?\n",
      "Yeah I want to watch it though I have not found the time yet. Black Panther is the richest superhero so he must be pretty good.\n",
      "Crazy to think there's a superhero richer than Iron Man. I guess Thor doesn't really count, since he's a god.\n",
      "xD. Tony Stark is only work $100 billion, Bruce Wayne $80 billion while black Panther is worth $500 billion.\n",
      "I wish I were \"only\" worth $100 billion. Black Panther basically owns a country, though, so those numbers make sense. Hadn't thought about Batman, either.\n",
      "It's interesting that the script in Black Panther is based on an actual ancient text. I thought it was just made up.\n",
      "I didn't know that. I don't think many superhero movies are based on source material that old. I wonder if that makes people from the ancient text's region feel closer to the movie.\n",
      "Speaking of cultural things Marvel censored \"Praise Hanuman\" in Indian releases of Black Panther thinking it would be culturally insensitive. But Indians reacted negatively as they found that empowering rather than insulting.\n",
      "That reminds me of Loony Toons removing Speedy Gonzales the mouse, which upset people from Mexico because he was a favorite character there. Maybe companies should actually ask the people they think they're offending before censoring things.\n",
      "Ha, you are right. When Wonder Woman first appeared as a member of the Justice Society she was the secretary. I wonder if that offended anyone.\n",
      "Her Lasso of Truth could see through anyone's lies about why they were late for appointments! But yes, it probably did. There's always someone looking to be offended. It causes problems when it prevents someone from being themselves, though.\n",
      "Gel Gadot, the new wonder woman, served two years as a soldier in the Israel Defense Forces. Things have changed a bit!\n",
      "She sounds like a wonder woman in real life, not just the Wonder Woman character! That movie was successful enough to change a lot of things, like what the highest-grossing superhero origin movie was.\n",
      "It is funny that Gal Gadot didn't know she was auditioning for Wonder Woman.\n",
      "I heard she was auditioning for Catwoman. Imagine trying to be a villain and ending up perfect for a superhero!\n",
      " Ah, so true! And Wonder Woman isn't only the highest grossing superhero origin movie it is the highest grossing WWI movie. Pretty cool.\n",
      "It also seemed like it did better than most other DC movies. That franchise hasn't been as successful as Marvel overall.\n",
      "The success of Wonder Woman has taught Hollywood that boys will happily accept a female superhero.\n",
      "Most people will accept anything if the surrounding movie is good enough, but Wonder Woman definitely paved the way for more acceptance once they realized that the superhero's demographic doesn't define the film - the effort everyone puts into the film does.\n",
      "You're right. Films need to be evaluated objectively without thinking about identity politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you watched Black Panther>\n",
      "Hello there, no I have not seen it yet but I really want to.  How about you?\n",
      "I haven't either. It must have been a good movie. Black Panther is the richest superhero.\n",
      "Yeah I can't imagine there being super heroes more wealthy than Bruce Wayne and Mr. Stark but I guess there is. \n",
      "Apparently Black Panther is worth $500 billion but Tony Stark is worth $100 billion and Bruce Wayne $80 billion.\n",
      "Yeah see and it's not even close!  \n",
      "I think it's cool that the symbols and script in the film are based on an actual script called nsibdi.\n",
      "Yeah that is really cool, I like when actual facts and real history are used in movies. \n",
      "But apparently they censored \"praise hanuman\" in Indian releases thinking they would get backlash for a villainous character praising a hindu God. They thought that it was empowering, not insulting.\n",
      "Yeah and it's always hard to predict how people will react to things. \n",
      "Right. What do you think about Wonder Woman?\n",
      "I think it is very cool that the movie was a big success.  I think it gives young girls something to cheer for instead of just the male superheroes, what about you?\n",
      "Yeah I think so too. Gal Gadot who is the new wonder woman, actually served two years as a soldier.\n",
      "Yeah I think I have read that before, that is impressive.  I heard she was really good in that movie as well. \n",
      "It's funny that she did not know she was auditioning for wonder woman. She thought she was trying out for cat woman\n",
      "That is pretty funny, do you know what year the original wonder women made an appearance?\n",
      "It's been a long time! I believe it was 1941.\n",
      "Good call!  Yeah I guess she was originally their secretary in the justice society. \n",
      "The success of Wonder Woman has taught Hollywood that boys happily accept a female superhero.\n",
      "Exactly, and yeah the money tells all about that, I know that movie did really well!\n",
      "Movies need to be objectively evaluated due to their cultural fluency, nuance and context. I guess Wonder Woman and Black Panther are successful in those aspects.\n",

      "Hey! It sounds crazy but there are several teenagers running for governor in Kansas. Of course, there are a lot of adults unhappy at the news.\n",
      "Didn't even know that was legal, surely they have to be 18 right?\n",
      "Actually no. But the state legislative committee is trying to pass a bill that would make 18 the minimum age. \n",
      "People are getting tired of career politicians and want something new, but then the high school trend started.  Crazy if a 16 year old would win. \n",
      "Would probably govern better than Trump though. Governor is a pretty big job for a teenager however. They govern the executive branch of the state, ranking right under head of state. So I'd think some age and experience would be helpful.\n",
      "At least they are motivated.  Held their debate way before the adults running for governor.  \n",
      "Yeah, that's true. When Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor of California, he had to commute 3 hours everyday because he didn't actually live in Sacramento. That's motivation too!\n",
      "Just read that inmates can run for office there too.  How about governing from state prison?  Think they need to take a look at the law a little closer.  \n",
      "Haha. That is truly crazy. And in Kentucky politicians have swear that they've never participated in a duel before taking office. Might be time to take a look at that law as well. \n",
      "that is hilarious! Did you know Austin TX voted to rename a garbage dump after Fred Durst? \n",
      "Haha. That's quite fitting. Leave it to Austin! Astronauts can vote from space... wonder what kind of absentee ballot they have to fill out?\n",
      "That is a very good question.  Space mail!\n",
      "In the United Kingdom, not all men could vote until 1918. \n",
      "thats strange.  Learn something new everyday\n",
      "Another strange fact: In India, they set up up a polling booth in a lion-infested forest just so one voter could go to the polls. \n",
      "that is strange.  And another, chicago is named the windy city because of the way politicians are there versus actual wind!\n",
      "Too funny. Speaking of big cities, New York City has no Walmarts because the local unions and politicians oppose them so much. \n",
      "good for NYC!\n",
      "Agreed. Maybe we should just go to a lottery system for selecting our politicians, like they did in Venice in the middle ages. They seemed to have some success with it. \n",
      "The lottery system is an interesting angle, couldn't be much worse than what we're getting  now.\n",
      "Been great talking to you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "do you know much about governors?\n",
      "SOme things. do you know who was the one that opposed the internment of japanese aerican during WWII?\n",
      "Yes that was Ralph lawrence, cannot believe he was the only one\n",
      "I know right? When texas elected their first female governor other stated did not even ave the amendment in place for it\n",
      "WOw they were ahead of the game it seems yet we do not think of them as such right?\n",
      "yes they sure are. In 1934 North Dakota declared martial law and decided to secede from the US\n",
      "Wow. DO you know where Schwarzenegger lived when he was Cali governor?\n",
      "Yeah he travelled to Sacramento every day by a private jet\n",
      "WOw what a waste of money and bad environmental impact at the same tme\n",
      "Yup pretty much. Did you vote in the last election?\n",
      "I sure did, In India they set up a voting poll for a single guy who lives in the forest with tigers\n",
      "Wow scary. Astronauts actually vote from the space\n",
      "That is so neat. In Alabama one third of the black males are not allowed to vote\n",
      "I think that has to do with the felony law policy that prevents them from doing so\n",
      "Yeah so sad. In Texas on the other hand they are voting to rename the garbage dump\n",
      "Hahha so funny. In the UK not all men could vote until 1918\n",
      "I wonder what prevented them from doing, maybe class and ranking in society\n",
      "I wonder , maybe. Do you know how officials were selected to office in the middle ages in Venice?\n",
      "Yes that was by lottery and it worked so well for them\n",
      "Yeah it seems so. James Buchanan had a boyfriend that the others in the office called his better half\n",
      "WOw. Did you know there is no Walmart in NY city?\n",
      "Yes and that is because local unions do not want them there\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "hi how are you? what do you know about mars?\n",
      "I am well and know nothing about mars, other than it is the red planet. do you know a lot?\n",
      "I do not know much. it is the fourth planet from the sun. it is named after the god of war.\n",
      "I did read that it is called the red planet because of the reddish iron oxide on its surface.\n",
      "Yeah, the sunsets are different there too. the atmosphere makes them blue. not much air on mars though.\n",
      "It has the impact craters of the moon and the valleys, deserts and ice caps of earth. How interesting!\n",
      "It looks like a place we could live, but i think it would take some work. \n",
      "A lot with all of that thin air! I wonder if it is actually possible.\n",
      "we would need atmosphere converters, plus some source of water, which might be there. the gravity would be lower and the year would be longer. \n",
      "Does that mean I would be lighter on Mars?\n",
      "Yes, but your muscles would probably atrophy too.\n",
      "That would be problematic. Sound shave a higher pitch on mars than they do on earth.\n",
      "Yes, we would sound a bit silly on Mars. But that would make life there more bearable, i think. LOL\n",
      "WOuld a colony is expectd on Mars by 2023.\n",
      "I think that is a bit ambitious. traveling there is a huge headache. then you get there and what? is backup or relief coming soon? sounds far fetched.\n",
      "Can you imagine losing a satalite on Mars?\n",
      "Yeah, that was a huge mistake. Feet vs. meters. Who uses feet any more? no one. no one uses that system.\n",
      "Only the US and we are too stubburn to get rid of it.\n",
      "yeah, but for engineering and science, it seems strange to me. Anyway, great chat!\n",
      "Ditto. Nice chatting with you!\n",
      "Have a great day!\n",
      "You too. Take care.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you live in a state where there is a governor ?\n",
      "Yes I do.  We just had an election for ours that was at the top of national news.\n",
      "Where I live the governor is mainly a symbol position representing the Queen, nothing like the USA. \n",
      "Governors have different powers between different political systems.  Schwarzenegger was a Governor in CA!\n",
      "I must have been tough for him to learn all the political stuff to be governor.  \n",
      "He was surely a \"star\"!  He commuted by private jet to Sacramento everyday! Our politics in the US is like a sport.\n",
      "Yeah there must a lot of money in the system when you can ask the Beatles for a campaign song \n",
      "Come together!!! Great song.  We watched a political fight play out over the temperature in a room.\n",
      "There is some debates about the ideal temperature of a room between men and women, since they typically dressed differently. \n",
      "Men seem to drive the temperature. It goes a little deeper though than just temperature.\n",
      "It goes to what is considered \"normal\" , and when this normal is driven by a masculine perspective, anything feminine becomes anormal.\n",
      "Sexist if you ask me.  Did you know that even dry cleaners charge women more for their clothing. --for the same shirt!\n",
      "The same goes to haircuts, razors and a lot of things.\n",
      "It seems men are considered to have the \"default\" body.  But on the flip side, women are considered the \"default\" parent.\n",
      "I don't see that as a positive, it only put more pressure on women and less pressure on men. \n",
      "Gender equality is a pressing issue.  A \"unisex\" shirt is even cut in men's style.\n",
      "Shirts have been worn by men at the start, that's why women shirts are considered special. But it should stop. \n",
      "I suppose some progress has been made.  But not enough.  I am happy to see so many more women in politics.\n",
      "And they are asking changes for women like Cynthia Nixon when she asked to raise the temperature for the primary debate. \n",
      "Yeah, that turned into a much bigger debate.  With half the worlds population being women, we sure do need to turn the temperature up!\n",
      "It is a long fight but it has to be done. Thanks for the conversation. \n",
      "Great convo!  I'm glad we agree on so many things.\n",

      "I was reading about teens in Kansas putting together a movement to run for govenor to combat young voter apathy. Amazing!\n",
      "Isn't it! They will be stopped but you have to give them a big high five for trying! They already moved a bill recently to ban anyone under 18 from running.....\n",
      "I love the idea that they care enough to try. Only 13% of young people ages 18 to 24 voted in the last nonpresidential election in Kansas. \n",
      "You do have to respect them for sure! And that is sad, all young adults need to vote! I hope that changes next time. Too many of these kids get mocked and laughed at and I hate that because it is their future!\n",
      "Shame on the adults for mocking them. I think that they have already earned respect by treating the election seriously, having well thought out opinions on the issues, and organizing a forum with opposing sides represented. Kudos to them!\n",
      "Definitely! In 1988 a chimp got 400,00 votes in a mayoral election in rio de janeiro....the chimp came in 3rd place. Funny. Even inmates here in the US can run so why not he kids!\n",
      "Absolutely. The first kid with the idea said he wanted to run to get more people involved in politics in a good way. The future of our country depends on thinking like that!\n",
      "Exactly! There are some in the state capitol are trying to keep teen candidates legal so that's a positive note!\n",
      "I agree. It will be interesting to see where this type of thinking leads us in the future...\n",
      "I think these kids will make some positive changes eventually they are very passionate about many issues in the government on every level\n",
      "Yes...I was reading about voting. I did not realise that 34% of the black male population in Alabama has permanently lost the right to vote. I wonder why that is?\n",
      "What??? How can that be? What are they doing living in the past....that's ridiculous. Did you Atheists cannot be Governor in South Carolina??? Weird\n",
      "Sounds like lots of odd stuff is going on in the South! Also weirdly, I read that not all men in the UK had the right to vote until 1918. Just for comparison, women got the right to vote in 1920.\n",
      "Very interesting! There is a brazilian proverb that say...our country grows at night when politicians are asleep....I love that!\n",
      "Oh, me too! I had not heard that! And pretty cool that in Texas, they elected their first female governor before some states had even ratified a female's right to vote.\n",
      "Really? That is awesome! Did you know Canadas first official money was actual playing cards...they cut them into shapes and signed by the governor...fun fact lol\n",
      "That sounds like Canada. I love the people and the country. Beautiful place and fun!  Hey, and in Kentucky, politicians must swear an oath that they have never participated in a duel before taking office. Lol!\n",
      "I love Canada too! Well weren't we just discussing  the south hahahaa...very strange!\n",
      "Yes, although that duel thing seems like it should have been going on out in the cowboy west in the old days.\n",
      "Right? They must have kept the laws from way back in time lol\n",
      "Lots of curious things that are fun to learn about. It has been great chatting with you. Thanks!\n",

      "Some stuff. DO you know who the only one to vote againts the internment of japanese american during WWII is?\n",
      "Yes that was ralph Lawrence, cannot believe he was the only one\n",
      "Yes. Did you know in Texas they elected a female governor, and that was ahead of many other states?\n",
      "Yeah they did not even have the amendement ratified then\n",
      "Yeah. In North Dakota the governor declared martial law in 1934\n",
      "Yes and then they seceded from the US\n",
      "Yeah. Did you know Schwarzenegger did not live in Sacramento when he was a governor?\n",
      "Yeah he commuted by a private jet everyday\n",
      "Yeah what a waste. Did you vote last time?\n",
      "I did. Do you know how officials were elected in ancient venice?\n",
      "I have no idea, how? Did you know astronauts vote from space?\n",
      "That is so cool and in venice they used to be elected by lottery\n",
      "WOw cool. In the UK not all men were allowed to vote until 1918\n",
      "Hmm I wonder what restrictions were in place then to prevent them\n",
      "No idea. In Alabama sadly one third of black males are not allowed to vote\n",
      "Yeah and that is a permanent ban, they lost the right\n",
      "Yeahsad. IN Austin Texas people seem to be busy voting for other things\n",
      "Yeah they really want to vote on renaming the garbage dump Fred Durst\n",
      "Hhaa people are really very different sometimes. Do you know how officials were elected in Venice in the ancient times?\n",
      "Yes that was all by lottery and it worked well\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you heard about the teenagers running for governor in Kansas? \n",
      "Yeah, so they moved forward a bill that bar people from running for office who were under 18, Crazy. \n",
      "That is kind of crazy, but good for those kids to show initiative. Maybe it can inspire younger voters to get out and vote.\n",
      "Yeah, voting is so important. In India the government set up a polling both in a forest filled with lions -- and for just one voter. \n",
      "That's really cool. I didn't know this, but astronauts are able to vote from space.\n",
      "That's awesome! In Austin, Texas, people voted to rename their trash dump after Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst. Haha. \n",
      "I agree with the sentiment that Limp Bizkit was not great. \n",
      "Haha. Amen. In the UK, not all men had the right to vote until 1918. \n",
      "That's crazy. It makes me sad that 34% of the black male population in my state has permanently lost the right to vote.\n",
      "That is sad. And insane. Every citizen should have the right to vote IMO. In Texas, they elected their first female governor before some states had even given women the right to vote. \n",
      "I agree, it should be a basic right that nobody should lose. That's awesome for Texas. \n",
      "I also read somewhere that the Beatles' song \"Come Together was written for Timothy Leary's 1969 campaign for governor of California. Who knew?\n",
      "That's a fitting song I guess. I've heard speculation that James Buchanan might have been our first and only gay president. He had a boyfriend whom other politicians referred to as \"his better half.\"\n",
      "Very interesting. Good for him. In Kentucky politicians have to swear an oath that they've never been in a duel before they're allowed to take office. Maybe a law that's needs to be updated, eh?\n",
      "That does need to be updated! They say that Chicago got it's nickname \"The Windy City\" after the boastful loquacity of its politicians rather than the actual gust of wind that shoot between buildings.\n",
      "I can see that. There are no Walmarts in New York city because the local politicians and unions don't want one. Maybe the only place in the US that doesn't have. Haha. \n",
      "I couldn't imagine that at all. There's a Wal-Mart on almost every corner where I live.\n",
      "Same. When Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor, he had to fly to Sacramento every day by private jet because he did not live there. \n",
      "I'm surprised he didn't take a helicopter. Everyday he could say \"GET TO THA CHOPPAH!\"\n",
      "Hahahaha! Perfect. North Dakota's governor declared martial law and seceded from the US in 1934. \n",
      "Oh wow that's pretty crazy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you into the marvel films?\n",
      "Yeah definitely! I love avengers infinity war although some people refer to it as an abusive family which I find odd.\n",
      "lol that is kind of funny and I can kind of see that. I felt that movie was great and can't wait for the finale End Game\n",
      "Yes it's going to be epic! Thanos played by Josh Brolin is such a brutal character.\n",
      "For sure, so thrilling when he is on screen. Avengers created a notable increase in shawarma sales after its release\n",
      "That is interesting why is that? Because Thanos is a greek name?\n",
      "I would think that is why. Did you ever read the marvel comics growing up?\n",
      "Yes sometimes I did. The marvel branding began back in 1961?\n",
      "wow that was a while ago! Good thing sony didn't buy the rights to all the characters in 1998, I think things would have been different\n",
      "Yeah that would've change things for sure. And only for $25 million dollars. Surprising.\n",
      "Right, I wonder how much Disney bought it for a few years back. I did hear disney didn't get complete rights to some of the characters\n",
      "Yes you are correct. They don't own the rights to show big Marvel characters at theme parks east of the Mississippi.\n",
      "I wonder why that is, that is interesting for sure. Stan Lee will be missed for sure. Did you ever hear about the superhero named Blue Ear?\n",
      "Yes Stan Lee may he rest in peace. Blue ear was created for a four-year-old boy who didn't want to wear hearing aids. That is really cool.\n",
      "That is so cool, I wonder if there are other created superheros like that\n",
      "Yes I'm not sure. Marvel successfully argued in court that mutants are not people and they got pay a lower rate on X-Men toys. Pretty funny. And smart.\n",
      "that is awesome and great marketing even lol. Were you into the guardians of the galaxy movies?\n",
      "Yes Chris Pratt is one of my favorite actors. James Gunn did an incredible job of directing it.\n",
      "I agree, I watched the first one so many times. It was different and very appealing to all senses. Did you ever hear what the China version was translated to?\n",
      "Oh yeah funny you should ask. Interplanetary unusual attack team. Ha ha that is hilarious.\n",
      "That is so accurate lol. I like it, it rolls off the tongue lol! It was so nice chatting with you, enjoy your day!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you seen the movie Avengers?  It is an interesting flick\n",
      "I have not. My daughter says I should. What can you tell me about it?\n",
      "There is a very controversial scene, where the adopted, brutalized daughter of the Titan is going to reveal a secret to stop him from torturing her sister.\n",
      "Sounds abusive to me. IS this supposed to make me interested?\n",
      "He had to sacrifice something he loves to recover the stone.  He sacrifices his daughter for the stone\n",
      "Bad choice if you ask me. Like, how many of these Marvel movies are there anyway? I like many of the actors, such as Cumberbatch, Ruffalo, Johansson, but I am way behind on storyline details and I fear too many movies have passed to allow me to catch up...\n",
      "There are a lot of  them.  I like the Guardian of the Galaxy one but I have not seen volume 2\n",
      "Yeah. I want to watch those too. I like Chris Pratt. I am also a hulk fan...Ferrigno\n",
      "Yes the original Hulk was great!  Marvel has been around forever - it started in 1939!\n",
      "Ok. Someone told me that the Avengers caused an increase in shawarma sales, but what the heck is a shawarma?\n",
      "I do not have a clue.  I do think its funny that the voice actor for Jarvis has never actually seen the movies\n",
      "Yeah.  I heard that there was a  Mary Poppins line in GG2. Do you know what that was?\n",
      "No I do not recall it.  I know that groot first appeared in 1959 however.\n",
      "I heard that Vin Diesel plays Groot in the film, and they wrote a separate script for him to help give him  a clue about voice inflection for one of his lines.\n",
      "Yes I can see Vin Diesel struggling with that.  I think its funny that in China they were referred to as a interplanetary unusual attack team!\n",
      "Gotta love it. I hear Sony was offered the right to Marvel characters for a mere $25 million and they balked. Epic fail.\n",
      "Absolutely!  They thought that Spiderman was the only superhero anyone would ever care about?  Had they never met a geek?\n",
      "Right? Can anyone say \"comic con?\"  But Sony is not the only studio with questionable ideas on this. Disney doesn't own the rights to many of the marvel characters for theme parks east of the Mississippi. Orlando is east of the Mississippi!\n",
      "Wow that is pretty nuts - Disney World is a huge park!  It is funny there is one character named Access who is owned by both Marvel and Dc who's only purpose is to keep the companies universes apart\n",
      "A sad reason to exist. Oh well, at least we get to watch it unfold. Avengers: Infinity War was the first movie to be filmed entirely using Imax digital cameras, so it should make for a spectacular show!\n",
      "Yes - and they are good folks in general - they even make a superhero for a 4 year old who wore hearing aids just so he could relate~!\n",
      "Nice! Enjoyed chatting!\n",
      "\n",

      "Hi, do you like the Marvel Comic Universe?\n",
      "Hi!, I would say I Love... something about super heroes and the possibilities of the universe that marvel movies offer, keeps people wanting more. Do you have a fav Marvel movie?\n",
      "I really liked guardians of the galacy and black panther. You?\n",
      "Its hard to choose, I like groot from the guardians of the galaxy but love scarlette johanson in Avengers.\n",
      "Did you know groot goes back to 1959? I had no idea.\n",
      "I didnt either! I found interesting how James Gunn really wanted Chris Pratt ( I dont balme him) for Guardians of the galaxy he was willing to cgi a six pack lol\n",
      "I could use that CGI in real life... Do you know anything about the May poppins line in the movie? I do not recall it.\n",
      "Me too! haha, I know that the line was ad libbed. Who was your fav character in the movie?\n",
      "I like Chris Pratt's character's interaction with the Racoons. It always makes me laugh.\n",
      "Yes! thats true, I do love their interaction too. That movie has alot of great actors I couldnt pick just one. I am a movie aficionado.  Mark ruffalo was awesome, zoe saldana to name a few\n",
      "Do you know what china/taiwan call the movie?\n",
      "No, What did they call it?\n",
      "Interplanetary Unusal attack team. It just rolls off the tounge!\n",
      "Lol, yea, just rolls off haha I cant beleive how far the Marvel corp has come since their start in 1939!\n",
      "Yeah. Has it been that long?\n",
      "Yes, apparantly by the early 50's they had generally become Atlas comics and the Marvel branding began in the 60's... its gone through its own evolution.\n",
      "That's crazy. I did read that there is a shared hero, access, between Marvel and DC to keep the two seperate. Inventive!\n",
      "That is! thus they are so successful, as an outsider its cool to see the growth but im sure from their point it was a challenge and they fought through until reaching success...gives me hope :)\n",
      "Agreed. I always feel bad for those who choose a side. I enjoy both sides so I won't choose.\n",
      "Im happy to be in the middle too, I cant choose. Although fun fact...did you know Vin Diesel played Groot? I think only in one of the movies but still I had no idea!\n",
      "I had no idea either! Nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi how are you? do you like superheroes?\n",
      "Hello,  great.  How about you?  Yes, i love superheroes.  Have you watched avengers infinity war?\n",
      "i have not. i usually dont watch superhero films. too many special effects, not enough story for me. i did like spider-man 2.\n",
      "Oh ok,  that was a good movie.  Avengers infinity war is the first film shot entirely in digital imax cameras. \n",
      "That is great! i think the technical innovation will make the theater experience so much better.\n",
      "The avengers movies caused a increase in shawarma sales lol\n",
      "what?? that is funny. the kids saw it in the movie and decided they wanted to eat it? LOL\n",
      "Most likely lol It was mentioned in a few movies and I guess it made everyone want some lol \n",
      "Ok, that makes sense. do you have a favorite marvel hero?\n",
      "hmmm I guess I like Thor,  Ant Man and Rocket from Guardians of the Galaxy. \n",
      "I like spider-man. i dont know the films. i heard guardians was pretty funny though. \n",
      "Yeah it was hilarious!!  Spiderman is cool too,  \n",
      "Ok, there was a sequel to guardians too. was that funny?\n",
      "Yes,  both were really good.  In taiwan and China they renamed it \"Interplanetary Unusual Attack Team\"  lol doesnt really roll off the tongue does it \n",
      "yes, that is a catchy name LOL i will surely remember it. IUAT. yes a good one. \n",
      "Thats so hard to say lol \n",
      "I should check out the film in english though. I dont like the combat and special effects. i like jokes and plot.\n",
      "Yeah it can definitely feel unrealistic.\n",
      "The computer graphics get a bit boring the older i get. Anyway, great chat!\n",
      "Great chatting,  thanks for the info. \n",
      "Yes, have a good night!\n",
      "Thanks you as well!\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Hi do you like rock music?\n",
      "Yes, I do like it a lot. Do you? What about jazz music?\n",
      "I listen to everything. lol  Viktor Tsoi kept his job in the boiler room of his apartment even after becoming the biggest rock star in Russian history!\n",
      "Wow, that's pretty good dedication to work! I've heard restaurants with loud rock type music can make patrons choose burgers over salads. What do you think about that theory?\n",
      "lol I think that's pretty interesting!  For some reason I can see it.  I can't explain it though.  The state rock song of Oklahoma is \"Do you Realize?\" by the Flaming Lips.\n",
      "Wow, that's an interesting pick of songs, it's much more modern of a rock song than I'd imagine. I've been in coffee houses where they play both rock and jazz. It's nice. Have you?\n",
      "I haven't been in coffee shops, but where I live there is a lot of wineries and they have live rock and jazz bands there.  So I can relate!  We're you ever a fan of Whitesnake?\n",
      "Not a huge fan, but I have heard their stuff. Not bad. What about you?  I really like Led Zeppelin, but I guess I'm not alone.\n",
      "I like Led Zeppelin.  Be nice if they did a reunion before it's too late.  Whitesnake has had 50 members throughout their history! lol\n",
      "Wow, that's a lot of members. It would be hard for a fan to keep track of them all! I guess rock music isn't always good in restaurants...Mario Batali's always played it and how he's got a lawsuit on his hands. \n",
      "Wow.  I didn't know that.  A Hanson song became a most requested track on a Chicago alt-rock radio station because the djs did not reveal the name of the band. lol\n",
      "Meant to say now he's got a lawsuit, not how, lol. That's funny about Hanson! Did you know Sweetgreen is a salad restaurant chain that used to have a music festival? Have you eaten there?\n",
      "I've never heard of that place.  lol  Do you have any other details about it?\n",
      "Only that it was sort of like Fresh Choice restaurants, and I have been there. Did you know some places play rock or other music so loud it can be a hazard for the people that work there? Scary.\n",
      "I can believe that!  The Led Zeppelin song \"Black Dog\" is named after a black lab that was wandering around the recording studio and doesn't have any real relation to the song itself.  That's interesting!\n",
      "I think it's funny how places are correlating loud rock music to eating pretty much junk food at restaurants. As if all people who like rock also like junk food? lol\n",
      "Right? lol  Led Zeppelin let Ben Affleck use \"When the Levee Breaks\" in Argo with condition he digitally alter the player's needle drop to a correct spot on the record.\n",
      "I really like how jack black got the rights to Led Zeppelin's \"immigrant song\" for the School of Rock music. It was a creative way with 1000 fans backing him.\n",
      "I liked that movie.  Cool.  Jazz trumpeters grew goatees as it provided comfort when playing.  Hmmm....that's different.  It's been fun chatting with you!\n",
      "Wow, that's pretty funny! I had an ex in a jazz band and he played the trombone. He didn't have a quirk like that, only bad jokes along with the bandmates! lol cya!\n",
      "LOL nice!  Have a good one!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you hear about how music can influence your food choices in a restaurant.\n",
      "Yes, I heard about that! Too funny, I guess louder music amps you up and people seem to eat bad foods lol\n",
      "I think I need to start either wearing ear plugs or eating places with no music.  lol\n",
      "Hahahaa! You and me both. I guess restaurant owners have known this for a long time, I guess it gets people to order more food too. \n",
      "Yeah, probably includes desserts too.  Music does really create a vibe.\n",
      "Yes, it does! I read that if they play Rock music, like maybe Led Zeppelin...the customers seem to order a lot of burgers with cheese and fries along with a few beers lol\n",
      "Even side salads are not even ordered, but bacon jam instead with the music louder.\n",
      "Hhaha, that's so interesting. I guess when they play Jazz music, people tend to make good choices and order food that is good for them. I guess it makes all decision making easier...I better start listening to jazz more hahaaa\n",
      "For real.  I might try this trick while shopping.  Maybe Ill make better food choices in the store.\n",
      "Exactly! Actually they say some supermarkets use the music in the same way, more upbeat or ambient...it makes a difference.\n",
      "Ive been to place with loud live music, it almost made me want to leave, but I did also want to drink more.  That is really crazy to think how that works.\n",
      "It is interesting, I guess when you go out to a place to have drinks and listen to a live band it's always so loud and it does amp you up. \n",
      "Did you know that led zappelin helped to fund monty python and the holy grail?\n",
      "What? That is cool. I love Monty Python and Led Zeppelin, \n",
      "Pink floyd and Genesis were in on it too.\n",
      "2 more great bands! The led Zeppelin song Black Dog...was named that because of a black lab that had been running around the studio, lol...they didn't even know the dog.\n",
      "Wow.  Crazy way to get a name for a band.\n",
      "I agree, lol I guess it worked out well though. So many great older Rock Bands, and it is crazy they are still around. Like the the band Whitesnake, through the years had 50 band members! Wow...\n",
      "Wow.  Did you know Sonic the Hedgehog was supposed to be a member of a rock band initially?\n",
      "Yes! And Sonic was supposed to have a blond haired girlfriend named Madonna! haha\n",
      "Great Chat!  Have a good night!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Its interesting how loud music can have an influence over your choices\n",
      "Wow, I had no idea!\n",
      "Yeah apparently you are more likely to order a burger instead of a salad in a place with loud music!\n",
      "I will need to start listening to softer music then. My belly does not need more burgers!\n",
      "I agree with you there lol, its amazing how music influence simple decisions and can lift the sales of a store, music sure has a deep power.\n",
      "I do rely on music when I am at the gym. I really need something upbeat and loud when I am lifting. I can listen to podcasts when I am doing cardio!\n",
      "Do you like any genre in particular? I sure love Rock music\n",
      "I like rock and dirty rock. I can throw in Rap and alt rock too. Classic rock too. \n",
      "Do you know the rockband the Whitesnakes?\n",
      "I do, yes. Why do you ask?\n",
      "So aparently the band has so many members that the list needed its own wikipedia page.\n",
      "HA! That's really funny. The state rock song of OK is by the flaming lips!\n",
      "Do you like the band Led Zeppelin?\n",
      "I do like them. Do you?\n",
      "I do like them, there are many interesting facts about the band like how the song Black Dog is named after a labrador that happened to be at the studio at the right time and date.\n",
      "I wonder if Sonic The Hedgehog was supposed to be a member of that band. He was supposed to have a girlfriend too!\n",
      "I guess he did pretty good for a dog lol, his girlfriend was named Madonna so that is a lucky dog\n",
      "I wonder if he likes jazz?\n",
      "He might, jazz is a genre that has influence a lot of people so who knows, theres even a programming language that is influenced by jazz\n",
      "It is seen as america's classical music. I love jazz.\n",
      "I love it too, you know that jazz trumpeters actually grow goatees because of the comfort they bring!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interesting that people tend to order something 'not good' for them like a burger at a noisier restaurant!\n",
      "Yeah maybe because loud noise makes them anxious and greasy food is comforting? No wonder restaurant owners are so concerned with creating the right atmosphere!\n",
      "Or hire a band when you have too much extra meat!\n",
      "haha yes. And also no surprise that at the Lucky Buns restaurant in Washington, the no bun/lettuce option for the burger is not a top seller!\n",
      "That place actually sounds pretty good. The kids screaming must blend right in!\n",
      "Yeah would be a good place to take kids for sure. I would find it a bit distracting if they played loud rock music. The classic rock version from the 1960's wouldn't be bad though.\n",
      "Yea, they should play some Led Zeppelin, been around since 1968.\n",
      "I would definitely be down with that. I think it's funny that  Hanson song became a most requested track on a chicago alt-rock station because the dj's didn't reveal the band!\n",
      "That's funny, and awful. whitesnake has apparently had 50+ members in their band over the years\n",
      "Hard to believe. I saw some pretty good jazz in New orleans once. Wasn't a huge fan but it is definitely popular. Apparently the trumpet players grow a goatee for comfort when playing.\n",
      "Interesting. I also see that clint eastwood is an enthusiast.\n",
      "I had no idea it was popular in Pakistan given that their jazz orchestra is topping the charts. \n",
      "apparnetly jack black made a video of himself with fans begging him to sing the immigrant song\n",
      "I have actually never heard that song! But his band Tenacious D is pretty funny. Also Sonic the hedgehog was supposed to be a member of a rock band and have a blond haired human girlfriend named Madonna. Rock is definitely out there.\n",
      "I wonder what Sonic would play?\n",
      "I am thinking either the electric guitar or drums. Led Zeppelin is definitely one of the biggest rock bands though. One of the best selling music artists in history.\n",
      "They even helped fund the monty python and thy holy grail movie\n",
      "That really shows how much of an impact they have. And to think that they were initially unpopular with critics...\n",
      "Yet absolutely hilarious!\n",
      "This conversation makes me want to got to a restaurant with Led Zeppelin and order a big cheeseburger!\n",
      "Lets go!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi, did you read the harry potter books or see the movies?\n",
      "I saw a couple of the movies. How about you? \n",
      "Yeah I saw the first three too. the guy who plays malfoy tried to steal the wand from the set\n",
      "Well, that sounds like a Malfoy like thing to do! He was staying in character. \n",
      "hahah that is very true. too bad he was caught\n",
      "Spielberg wanted to make Harry Potter as an animated movie. Seems like an odd choice. He doesn't really do much animation.\n",
      "Yeah I have never heard him do animations. do you know the reward daniel got for winning the role of harry?\n",
      "Um, a job? I don't know. What did he get?\n",
      "was allowed to stay up and watch fawlty towers\n",
      "Terry Gilliam was Rowling's first choice to direct the first movie. A Monty Python guy? I guess it could work for a children's film. Fawlty Towers had a Monty Python alum.\n",
      "there was an unauthorized sequel in china with hobbit characters with harry potter names\n",
      "China seems to have an unauthorized everything these days. Maybe even Monty Python. Perhaps unauthorized Chinese Stephen Fry did the narration.\n",
      "ha-ha maybe, yeah seems like it. do you like Johnny Depp?\n",
      "We don't really get along. He has a different artistic vision, so we parted ways. \n",
      "I did not know he directed the film 'the brave'\n",
      "Is that the film about some native person?\n",
      "Yes that is it. and he seems to be working on a movie about dr. Seuss\n",
      "I hope he does a good job.  I like biopics.\n",
      "Yeah me too. have you seen edward scissorhands?\n",
      "Yes, I saw it many years ago. I thought the casting was perfect, though it was an odd tale.\n",
      "yes it was pretty odd. Apparently Depp only said 196 word in the entire film\n",
      "Paid by the word, as I suspected. These stars have their demands. \n",
      "Yup, for sure. nice chatting with you :)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a fan of Johnny Depp? \n",
      "Yeah, I like some of the roles he's played.  Seems like when he teams up with Tim Burton it's always a good combination for instance.  How about you?\n",
      "I thought he was ok in 21 jump street. \n",
      "Oh, wow, you're waaaay back.  Haven't thought of that TV series in awhile!  LOL.  I think it awesome of him how he adopted the one eyed horse he used in Sleepy Hollow after hearing it was going to be put down.\n",
      "I think Richard Greico replaced him on it, right? \n",
      "I'm not sure... I know Greico had his own TV series after a bit (Booker) but dunno if he replaced Depp on that show for awhile or what.  It's been too long, my memory's all fuzzy..  \n",
      "Oh yeah! I forgot about that. Hilarious. Did you know Johnny Depp only says 196 words in Edwards Scissorhands?\n",
      "No, I didn't know that.  Although I do recall his character not being the most talkactive fellow in that film.  Speaking of Depp, I heard he's working on a biopic of Dr Seuss.  That should be interesting to watch!  If it comes out...\n",
      "Hmmm, that sounds interesting. What about Fantasy, do you  like that genre? \n",
      "Oh, I like fantasy!  Used to play D&D a bit back in the day (still would, if I knew of any local groups that were open.)  But it's not just that, I'm told some people fantasy draft the national spelling bee.  Don't ask me how THAT works.\n",
      "I think they just pick a bunch of kids that they think will win? \n",
      "That might work.  I'm told they also have a Fantasy Congress... what do you think of that one?\n",
      "Sounds even more boring. LOL\n",
      "I'd like a fantasy congress that doesn't waste huge amounts of tax payer money and does what's best for the country.  That would be a REAL fantasy.  \n",
      "Yup, that will never happen. Did you know a single fold in the brain makes the difference between fantasy and reality? \n",
      "That's pretty neat.  I know some people that I think have that fold missing!  So, how about you?  You like fantasy much?  \n",
      "Not too much. Most of the shows that I watch go on for too long and I lose interest. \n",
      "Speaking of long, there was a janitor that wrote a 15,145 page fantasy manuscript called In the Realms of the Unreal.  It's actually a fascinating story, I saw a documentary on it on Youtube!\n",
      "Interesting. Do people like it? Well, nice chatting with you!\n",
      "It's kind of popular among artist, at least, the parts that have been published.  No one's been able to gather the whole thing.  Anyway, good talkign to you as well! \n",
      "Take it easy!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you like the Fantastic Beasts movies?\n",
      "I do, although I have not seen the newest one. Have you seen them?\n",
      "Yes,, The ‘Fantastic Beasts’ sequel goes surprisingly dark, with a shocking reveal at the end\n",
      "Really! I guess the first one was a little dark too. I feel like the Harry Potter movies went from pretty light and tame to pretty dark. I'm rewatching with my son...\n",
      "That's cool.    You may not want him to see this one yet.    As the film opens,  the title character, an evil wizard played by Johnny Depp, is seen escaping from detention \n",
      "I may need to see it before my son does. He's 7 and I worry about the later HP movies. We're dragging our feet on movie 3 because of that too. Speaking of HP, Jason isaacs who played lucius malfoy in the harry potter films was caught trying to steal his wand from the set\n",
      "I loved him in Star Trek.     Did you know that as a reward for winning the part of harry potter, daniel radcliffe was allowed to stay up and watch fawlty towers\n",
      "As a reward for winning the part of harry potter, daniel radcliffe was allowed to stay up and watch fawlty towers\n",
      "Production took place over ten years, so at the end he could watch whatever he wanted!\n",
      "An unauthorized harry potter sequel was sold in china consisting of \"the hobbit\" with the names changed to harry potter characters! Who knew!\n",
      "I heard that he main character of \"troll\" was named harry potter, back in 1986 !\n",
      "What! That's crazy!\n",
      "They will never get Johnny Depp, has won the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Awards for Best Actor in one of those knockoffs!\n",
      "In the harry potter universe, hogwarts is located in scotland, not england. I did not know that.\n",
      "Well, it is the third highest-grossing film series with $7.7 billion in worldwide receipts so they can do as they wish!\n",
      "Johnny depp directed the 1997 film 'the brave'\n",
      "Quite a leap after Depp rose to prominence on the 1980s television series 21 Jump Street\n",
      "Johnny depp is producing and possibly starring in a biopic about the life of theodor geisel, aka dr. seuss. WEitd, hih?\n",
      "Well, hopefully he will have more dialogue than in his past films. Johnny depp only said 196 words in edward scissorhands\n",
      "Really! That's crazy? Gene wilder refused to watch the 2005 remake of willy wonka because he didn't want to be disappointed in johnny depp\n",
      "That's cool.    Comedic fantasy author terry pratchett was knighted for his \"services to literature\".     Neither Depp or Wilder has that honor.\n",
      "People fantasy draft the national spelling bee. I turned it into a drinking game.\n",
      "Good for you.   Not quite like A janitor from chicago who wrote over six years a 15,145-page fantasy manuscript\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is your overall impression of the Harry potter Series?\n",
      "It is very exciting, great for kids and adults, what do you think?\n",
      "I also think that it is exciting and believe that a great amount of work has gone into getting the series where it should be. \n",
      "Five of the series' eight films are among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time! That's incredible.\n",
      "That is true. It is also interesting to note that it is the third highest-grossing film series with $7.7 billion in worldwide receipts. \n",
      "Wow, i see that the boy that played Malfoy was caught trying to steal the wand he used on set.\n",
      "Wow, I do not see any professionalism in his actions. I wonder if they brought him back after that. \n",
      "It doesn't say if it was after production was over or if it was the at the beginning.  I also believe that author J. K. Rowling, lived in her car when writing these books before they were movies.\n",
      "Yeah, I have heard of similar stories, of individual struggles before they hit the big league. \n",
      "One other star is Tyler Perry who plays Madea in all of those movies. I love the whole Harry Potter series, it's my favorite.\n",
      "Interesting I did not know tyler Perry played in Harry Potter movies. \n",
      "He didn't, but he was homeless living in his car when he first started writing for his movies, sorry for the confusion!\n",
      "Oh, I see. What do you think about Johnny Depp as an actor?\n",
      "He is very versatile, he can play so many different types of characters, he's very talented.\n",
      "I agree, he is a very talented individual. I think his pirates of the Caribbean series also made a significant amount of money. What do you think?\n",
      "Yes it did make a sizable amount of money.  I like the pirates of the caribbean movie series and I like Au Chocolate, the movie he filmed in another country.\n",
      "Wow, yes I have seen parts of that movie. \n",
      "Do you remember the movie, What's eating Gilbert Grape? He played in it with Leonardo De Caprio?\n",
      "NO, sorry I do not remember that particular movie. \n",
      "It was his first movie, I think.  It was not a very good movie, so you didn't miss much! LOL\n",
      "I think that movies that have a fantasy theme to them, make a lot of money in the box office. \n",
      "I don't personally like Fantasy themed movie or books, do you?\n",
      "I'm not too particular when it comes to Genre. As long as it has a good story line. \n",
      "You have a good point, I see that Fantasy author Terry Pratchett was actually knighted for his Services to Literature, that's is special!\n",
      "True\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "I've never seen Jurassic World and I get the criticism that it's a departure from the message of the original Jurassic Park, but I'd still like to see it.\n",
      "I see.  What is the departure from the message of the original?\n",
      "The original was that nature couldn't be controlled, and that human attempts to do so would have unintended consequences. Apparently Jurassic World abandons that.\n",
      "Ah.  Well for a movie about dinosaurs, for the dinosaurs to only be in the movie for 15 minutes seems like not a very good idea.\n",
      "Agreed. I'd also like to see an updated version of Jurassic Park with feathered dinosaurs. T. Rex as a giant enraged fighting cock would be amazing.\n",
      "Well considering Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow are writing and Steven Spielburg is still executive producing, I highly doubt your dream will come to fruition.\n",
      "Yeah, the feathered dinosaur thing turns a lot of people off. I've never seen Westworld either -- have you?\n",
      "Yes, I think it pretty good Evan Rachel Wood who plays Dolores in the show is fantastic.  There are some real subplots going on the entire time, I recommend it.\n",
      "I'll have to check it out. I vaguely recall seeing the old West World movie with Yul Brynner when I was a kid.\n",
      "Well the theme is sort of this, humankind has the technology but not the wisdom to not use it because it is being used for destructive purposes.\n",
      "Yeah, apparently Jurassic World is a departure from that, but I'd have to see it myself to actually say.\n",
      "If you want to watch something that sticks with Michael Crichton's message from the source books, try \"Prey\" or \"Next\".  They both focus on the potentially bad side of technology.\n",
      "Yeah, those are definitely both things I should check out. There was an actual event similar to the Prey scenario involving a genetically engineered root bacteria that might have eventually spread and destroyed most plant life on earth.\n",
      "So I wonder how hot the raptor suits were in Jurassic Park.  I thought it was all computer generated, shows what I know.\n",
      "Yeah, I\"m amazed. I would never have had any idea. I just assumed they were CGI like the big ones.\n",
      "I do know the raptors on the Jurassic Park ride are robotic for sure.  It is a pretty fun experience.  It cost twice as much as the movie to make which is hilarious.\n",
      "If I was a little kid I'd love that ride.\n",
      "The T-Rex on the other hand in the movie was CGI, it apparently took like 6 hours to render one frame back then.  Computers have come a long way for sure.\n",
      "I can remember how realistic it looked when I first watched the movie.\n",
      "Long as Chris Pratt is not in it, its a good movie.  Not a fan.\n",
      "I'm not familiar with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Wow, that is unfortunate that the creator of Tetris did not get any royalties from the game.\n",
      "Yeah, Alexey Pajitnov didn't get any money for creating tetris - a game so famous that most people who aren't gamers have still heard of it.\n",
      "Yeah, even though Tetris was invented way back in 1984, it is still super popular today.  It is one of the 3 highest selling games of all time\n",
      "Yeah, that's why there's about a bazillion versions of the game on many different game consoles. I recently heard of some new version called Tetris effect.\n",
      "That is the game on Playstation VR.  I bet it is even more addictive than the original\n",
      "Yeah, I've heard about that VR stuff. I thought they'd go the route of 3-D movies but I've been told VR games are actually good. I'm curious what VR would add to something like Tetris, though.\n",
      "It adds a more imersive feel to the game.  It amplifies the experience in almost a medatative way\n",
      "Really? Sounds interesting. I might have to try that. I wonder if that would also magnify the tetris effect of helping people with ptsd. \n",
      "It is actually proven scientifically to aid the recovery of people dealing with trauma.  So PTSD sufferers would benefit.\n",
      "What do you think of the zone mode they put into Tetris effect? Do you think it adds a cool new mechanic into a classic game or do you think they're fixing what isn't broke?\n",
      "I am more old school in my gaming, so I would prefer to classic version, but I can see how some would like the zone mechanic\n",
      "Yeah, when I think of tetris, I think of when I was a kid with my Gameboy trying to pass time until I could get home to the NES. It will feel a bit off playing Tetris on my PlayStation 4, though it might be just my warm fuzzy nostalgia.\n",
      "Heck I still have my old PS2.  It is the most popular system of all time, with over 150 million units sold\n",
      "I wish I still had my PS2, sadly it broke when it fell off the entertainment centre. Though I have one of the old PS3s that can play PS2 games. You know, the Department of Defense used 1760 PS3s and made a super computer out of them to save money, hahaha!\n",
      "Wow.  I used to have a Playstation Portable, but I haven't tried the newer PS Vita.\n",
      "Yeah, I hear the vita's pretty good, but it didn't sell well against its rival the Nintendo 3DS. Still, most Playstation products sold very well.\n",
      "Oh yeah, the PS4 sold 1 million in the first day it was out.\n",
      "Wow! And PS3s are being used to research black holes. It's pretty impressive what they can get PlayStations to do.\n",
      "I guess they really mean that \"Greatness Awaits\" slogan that they use on TV commercials.\n",
      "Mabye so. I guess greatness awaited tetris as well. Tetris on PlayStation, perhaps it will be a great game.\n",
      "Maybe I can use my PS4 to do my own black hole research.  I would be more productive than playing Grand Theft Auto\n",
      "Mabye you can. I wonder if the newer Grand Theft Auto Games have the soundtrack on the disc like the original on PS1 did.\n",
      "I would doubt it.  They probably realize that most people do not even have CD players anymore\n",
      "Actually, try sticking a CD into a DVD or Blu-ray player. Most of them can still play CDs!\n",
      "Really, good to know.  I normally don't even use discs.  I get most of my games from the Playstation store\n",
      "Yeah, changing discs is a hassle and the playstation store is more convenient. Though it is funny to use a PS4 as a CD player, hahaha.\n",
      "Quite a versitle machine, from a CD player to a government super computer\n",
      "Yeah, very impressive. It's also strange that Fifa 14 was on PS2, PS3 and PS4.\n",
      "I would imagine that the graphics were very different between the 3 different versions.\n",
      "Yeah, I wonder if it was the same game just with different graphics or if the better versions got more features. That would've confused the heck outta me, having 3 versions of the same game.\n",
      "I can imagine it was probably 3 different games with different features.  \n",
      "Yeah, the PS3 and PS4 versions were probably 'better'. It would be annoying to buy the game for a feature you wanted, only to find out you bought the wrong one.\n",
      "Just like any technology, there will always be something bigger and better out there.  With the PS4 being released in 2013, there is only a matter of time before the 5th version is out\n",
      "Yeah, I wonder what kind of Tetris they can put on the PS5. Mabye holodeck tetris or something, haha.\n",
      "It is probably just going to be a chip they put into your brain\n",
      "Yeah, most likely. That would be some amazing VR, though - right in your brain. They better not put an unlock code for your brain like they did for the PS3, though.\n",
      "I can see it now, massive data breach and all PS5 owners banks accounts are wiped out\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you like movies? did you watch the latests Jurassic Park movie?\n",
      "No.  Who is the main actor?\n",
      "It has several great actors one of them is Chris Patt, the movie had a cost of $110 million\n",
      "Is Chris Patt in the latest Jurassic Park?\n",
      "Yes he is, he is the leading actor in fact, I think it's a great sequel, although the dinosaurs appear for just a few minutes\n",
      "But it was about the dinosaurs.\n",
      "Yeah but they didnt appear much in the movie, another intesting fact is how raptors were generated, you would think they were made by computers but no\n",
      "The last Jurassic was not directed by Spielberg.  Is it as good as the first one?\n",
      "No, it was directed by J.A Bayona, im not familieared with hiw work but the movie was ok so Im guessing he has the talent\n",
      "Spielberg was still involved so it must have been good.\n",
      "I agree Spielberg is a great director, you know that it took 6 hours to render a part of the T-Rex in Jurassic Park, sounds expensive.\n",
      "It does sound expensive.  I need to watch the fallen kingdom.\n",
      "You do! its a good movie and you wont regret watching it\n",
      "Is Pratt a good actor?\n",
      "He is a good actor he is also one of the leading actors of Guardians of the Galaxy, so yeah I like him\n",
      "He used to live in a van in Hawaii.\n",
      "He did, I bet he had it really hard, he was actually a waiter at a Bubba Gump shrimp restaurant and he got scouted, thats a really lucky break\n",
      "Yes, he was lucky because there are a lot of good talents out there.\n",
      "I agree, he joked about having the lead role on Jurassica Park and I guess his joke became a reality!\n",
      "Spielberg might have read his comment.\n",
      "I think he did or maybe he just liked his role on Guardians of the Galazy, you know he stole the costume of the movie so he could visit sick children at hospitals\n",
      "I think you are right.  Anyway, nice chatting with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "Hello. I'm alright. How are you?\n",
      "I am great. I am just watching some Golden State Basketball. Do you like the NBA?\n",
      "Not really. I'm more into tabletop games and video games than sports. I'm especially good at Tetris.\n",
      "Nice! I used to play tetris all the time and was terrible at it. I tried so hard and got no where. I felt like a huge tetris failure and the harder I tried the more pressure and the more failure.\n",
      "Really? I find it relaxing. Something about the music and the repetitiveness, I guess. But I suppose it can make me a little anxious when it gets really fast and/or really close to the top. Or if I mess up.\n",
      "OH my lord, when it sped up I got so anxious and you could basically bet I was going to lose wihtin a few pieces. The other day I was thinking about spy hunter. Did you ever play that game?\n",
      "I'm not familiar with that one. Is it new? Apparently I need to get a PS4, because there's a new version of Tetris - Tetris Effect. What kind of a game is Spy Hunter?\n",
      "Spy hunter was an old school, like commedore 64, game. I don't remember the system but I remember loving it. It was so basic. You drove a car and had to out run the cops. You had oil slicks and missle to get away. I was bad at that too but it was fun. I guess I am not good at video games...\n",
      "Oh that's cool. I used to work at a game store, so I have several old-school systems, including an Atari. We had a Commodore 64 in the store once, and I should've bought it when I had the chance. Sadly, I've never gotten to play one. I'm not very good at video games either. I guess I'm more of a collector than a serious gamer. They're a good way to relax when I have time. Also, I just found out that apparently playing Tetris can help people with addictions. I'm going to share that information with my roommate, who's a smoker. Unfortunately, I can't bring my Game Boy to work, so it probably can't help with my soda addiction.\n",
      "That's ok, at least it's not smoking. I have a coffee addiction so we're in the same boat. I had 4 cups today and I am dragging. What else do you do for fun?\n",
      "I've got a ton of nerdy hobbies. I'm a Star Wars costumer in the 501st Legion, for starters. I'm also a historical reenactor. I also enjoy geocaching and running. How about you?\n",
      "I have a full time job, teach college, have two kids a wife, and do a lot of HITs. I do not have a lot of time. I wake up at 4 to go to the by 4:30. I lift until 6:30 so I guess that is my free time.\n",
      "Dang. I am NOT a morning person. I get up for work at 7. I might get up earlier than that for something I really want to do - like catching a plane or saving daylight for a long geocaching trip - but usually I prefer to sleep in. I also have a full time job, and a side gig, but I'm still single. I do have two roommates and a cat. My hobbies take up a lot of time, which is why playing video games is usually at the bottom of the list.\n",
      "Waking up at 4 was tough when I first started but now, it's second nature. It's really a great option for me because I have no time to do it other wise. Its so relaxing and clears my mind.\n",
      "I guess I could do it as long as I went to bed early enough. Typically I don't go to bed until around midnight.\n",
      "I go to be at 8. I thought about it and I usually do nothing from 8 - midnight so I just cut out the tv and went to bed. It makes sense for me. Maybe go to the gym at night? My gym is open 24/7 and I am not proud to say that I have been there at 11 pm on a friday!\n",
      "I've pretty much already cut out tv. I don't pay for cable; I pretty much just watch stuff online or buy DVDs. I go running some evenings. I'm part of a local running group. Our current schedule is Saturdays at 9 am and Tuesdays at 6 pm. I've never really gone to the gym for anything. I think I'd like to try some strength training, but I don't know how to use any of the equipment, and I can't afford a personal trainer, so it's pretty intimidating.\n",
      "Don't be intimidated. I'm sure you can figure it out. I usually just fake it until I figure it out.\n",
      "Fair enough. With my running group, our mantra is no matter how we're doing, we're already doing better than everyone who's still on the couch. I'm not fast by any means - I doubt I'll ever win any age group awards or anything like that - but I get it done. Plus, it's better to run and then partake in bad habits (like drinking soda and sitting around playing video games) than to not run and still partake in bad habits.\n",
      "True... Nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, have you ever played Tetris?\n",
      "I have. one of my favorites. I say its how I learned how to pack things in my fridge. I love how its one of the top sellers still to this day.\n",
      "I think Tetris gives us principles for many things, like accommodating things on my trunk, It looks like it can have benefits like it can help  quit smoking\n",
      "ohhh really. I didnt know that I need to stop smoking. I will be looking into to. I wonder if they have it for the playstation. Probably you think?\n",
      "It would be nice, and it is said that It can also help when sticking to a diet is difficult. Probably because you get addicted to the game and stop thinking about food\n",
      "yeah youre totally right. So there must be a playstation game out there to help with addiction too. If the department of defense is using it, then I can use it for health.\n",
      "Isn't that cool. that 1760 playstation 3's were used to build a super computer and it was a cheaper option!!\n",
      "wow so cool. I feel like there must be a movie on this.  I want to know all the history. I know playstation in itself wins so may awards or innovations. I want to see that come to life.\n",
      "Did you know Playstation 3's are being used to research black holes?\n",
      "oh I did not know that. I wonder how that is even happening. Very cool to know. I wonder what kind of music they're listening to while doing so. Maybe Jazz ;)\n",
      "Do you like Jazz? I love it, one of my favorite types of Jazz is Gypsy jazz!! \n",
      "I like it some. I like the women from Harlem who make music. Great piano players. know any?\n",
      "Jazz is so unique and you find this sort of things, like this woman who holds a concert on sundays and has done it for 20 years!\n",
      "yea and Pakistan jazz is currently at the top of that list. Thats so cool to find out\n",
      "See, I always think about jazz from America and Europe but I really want to hear this orchestra from Pakistan, they must be great! \n",
      "have to be. Im guessing rich in tradition. ... while we have our African Americans to help us stay connected to it all\n",
      "Jazz has traveled everywhere, because in a great part it came from west Africa and then other things adopted from African american culture.\n",
      "yes and then back to america to refine. I use to listen to the fatter tempo stuff as a kid\n",
      "A famous actor who loves jazz is Clint Eastwood did you know that?\n",
      "I do, Im not a fan of him then, to me that makes him kinda a poser\n",
      "Well , it was very nice to talk to you today. Have a good one!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "do you like tom cruise?\n",
      "Yes I do. Did you know the last samurai is in the plural form?\n",
      "Hmm I thought it referred to one samurai, how come?\n",
      "Yeah it is in reference to the clan of samurai , not just one\n",
      "Oh cool. Did you know Tom sued the inventor of the hoveround, Kruse, over the use of name?\n",
      "wow that is close. Aladdin's face was based on Tom\n",
      "Cool. Seinfeld has way more money than Tom Hanks and Cruise together\n",
      "WOw how much money does he have under his name then?\n",
      "Well his net worth is $82 million\n",
      "WOw that is a lot. Did you know Trey Parker and Matt Stone once got Cruise kick out of Paramount?\n",
      "Wow what did he do? Cruise spent two years in Japan when he was preparing for the role of the samurai\n",
      "WOw that is dedication. Cruise can never be a honorary citizen of Paris\n",
      "Wow he must have rubbed them the wrong way somehow\n",
      "I guess. DId you watch Avengers Infinity War?\n",
      "I did, it is the first film shot with digital imax cameras\n",
      "Nice. The guy who played Jarvis in Iron Man has never seen the films\n",
      "Cool. DO you know who is the waitress that Captain America saves in the Avengers movie?\n",
      "I have no idea, is it someone we have seen elsewhere too?\n",
      "Yes that was also gretchen in Recess\n",
      "Oh nice. Disney is not allowed to show the big name Marvel characters in their parks east of Mississippi\n",
      "\n",
      "Wow that is strange, maybe there are some legal issues in there\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you doing this evening?\n",
      "pretty well and you?\n",
      "I'm doing great! Do you like Tom Cruise and his films?\n",
      "I like him in some yes, like mission possible and the last samurai\n",
      "He spent two years learning Japanese and swordplay in preparation for the filming of the Last Samurai. He's pretty dedicated.\n",
      "that is hardcore dedication for sure. aladdin's face was based on him\n",
      "That's funny! I never made the connection. He seems like he's a bit out of touch with the average person's reality though. He decided to spend $10 million on an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens. Does he know something we don't?\n",
      "it might seem like it, since he invested all that money\n",
      "Maybe he can sell it for a profit later on, and use his celebrity status to up the price. Are you a fan of the Star Wars films?\n",
      "yeah that is possible. that will still not be enough to lift the ban that the city of paris put on him\n",
      "Paris banned Tom Cruise? Why? \n",
      "not sure, he must have done something. well they put a ban on declaring him a honorary citizen\n",
      "Oh, ok. I haven't really kept up on the Star Wars films. After the first three, they lost their magic to me. \n",
      "yeah seems like with most movies, the first few are so good and then it is downhill\n",
      "Lucas has never won an Oscar, but his wife has. George will just have to make do with his billions.\n",
      "well she is the one who made some remarkable changes to the script so I think she derves it\n",
      "Yeah, George really needs a guiding hand on things or he just doesn't focus the story. He's creative, but might have trouble with story structure.\n",
      "yeah. 20th century fox thought the movie was going to flop\n",
      "Lucas got the merchandising rights and the rest is history. The franchise has made many people rich. James Earl Jones was paid $7,500 for the first movie, but I bet he got a bunch more in the next ones.\n",
      "yeah that is pretty remarkable, there is no way of knowing when the next genius is going to strike\n",
      "Probably JJ Abrams. He seems to have the touch. I enjoyed chatting! Have a good evening!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi do you like movies?\n",
      "Good Afternoon! Yes, I do enjoy movies and I try to watch a new release at least once a month.  You?\n",
      "That is cool, do not do it as often. One of the ones that I admire the most is star wars series which started in 1977\n",
      "For sure - Star Wars has been an epic anthology, save for the middle 3 (first 3), but I did enjoy all of them and can't wait for the new ones!\n",
      "It is still alive!! Did you know that back in 2013 it was dubbed in Navajo?\n",
      "I did not know that - I wonder how many languages it has been translated to?  Or how many countries it's been released in - fascinating! \n",
      "I imagine many many languages  but this was neat because it is the first major film put in an american native langauge\n",
      "Awesome - The Navajo community is very relevant where I live and I had no idea that Star Wars was the first major film ever translated to a Native American language.  Assuming it was all 9+ of the movies?\n",
      "I would imagine that. I found interesting that Marcia Lucas, George's wife influenced the movies\n",
      "I have heard that before, especially with the first movie, she had a lot of input and influence on scenes and characters.  I bet they have a solid relationship!\n",
      "She had to do with Obi Wans death, and Leia's good luck kiss, and she did a good job because she won an academy award.\n",
      "Carrie Fisher (Leia) won an Oscar for Star Wars?  Those are all vivid, iconic scenes - even with the later revelation that Luke and Leia are brother/sister..\n",
      "That is pure fiction!! Did you know that Darth Vader's lines were recorded in about 2.5 hours?\n",
      "2.5 hours seems about right, he didn't speak very often - mostly just heavy breathing...\n",
      "hahaha that is true, James earl Jones got paid $7500 for that.\n",
      "Vader's voice (JEJ) is probably my favorite childhood memory of Star Wars.  The first time I saw it, the voice was so calm, unique and creepy\n",
      "It sure did get stuck in our minds, I think he should have been paid more!!\n",
      "Seems fair for 1977 and they had no idea it was going to be a billion dollar industry - no way!\n",
      "looking from that perpective, it is probably fine, but Star Wars got so big that it even holds a Guiness record for being succesful in merchandising, and I think we all want to have something from star wars\n",
      "Amazing how they've kept it going and gotten better in most aspects.  The Last Jedi was awesome!\n",
      "I think they make us dream!! Well it has been nice talking to you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you like Star Wars?\n",
      "Absolutely!  How about yourself? \n",
      "Not that much though I think it's a awesome franchise. I like that it has been dubbed in different languages for people to enjoy. It has even been dubbed in Navajo, the first major film to do so.\n",
      "I did hear that,  that is pretty cool.  I hear that the entire star wars is actually told by r2d2 hundred of years after the jedi!\n",
      "Wow, I had to wrap my mind around that. George Lucas' wife put in many little details in the film. SHe got an Academy Award for editing. Her husband didn't get an award for directing.\n",
      "Yeah that is amazing!  Have you watched avengers infinity war?\n",
      "I haven't actually. I hear it's the first film ever to be shot completely with digital imax cameras.\n",
      "Yeah the next movie is coming out next month,  it was left with a pretty big cliff hanger. \n",
      "Interesting. So it is the 2nd in a trilogy?\n",
      "I have no idea if its going to be a trilogy.  it is the 3 movie in the avenger series,  but the next one is going to be the 4th. \n",
      "Oh, I see. Wow, I am really behind. I have not seen any of them. Also, do they eat shawarma in the films?\n",
      "Yeah Tony Stark talks about eating shawarma in the first one and I think hes eating it in the other 2 lol Now its a thing. \n",
      "Oh, I see, that's why shawarma sales increased. Now I want one.\n",
      "Its not a big scene lol amazing what a little tv time can do.  \n",
      "Right, haha! When I was younger I used to watch the hulk. I guess Lou Ferrigno who voiced the Hulk voiced him for decades up to Avengers Age of Ultron.\n",
      "Yeah hes still making money for that role,  amazing.  It looks like the guy who is the voice of jarvus has never seen any of the movies lol \n",
      "Wow I wonder why that is?\n",
      "I have no clue,  I thought everyone has to be at those hollywood movie premieres lol \n",
      "That is a good point. I wonder if Tom Cruise has seen all his movies? If not he can catch up watching them when aliens come. He has a bunker in case they do.\n",
      "lol that is interesting.  I wouldnt mind having an alien bunker!  lol Did you know Aladdins face is based on tom cruise?\n",
      "No I did not notice that. Do you think they look alike?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you ever play Tetris when you were younger?\n",
      "I loved Teris on game boy!  How about you?\n",
      "Sure did. I heard there is a new version available for the Playstation 4. And you can actually play it in virtual reality grabbing the blocks with your hands.\n",
      "Read that as well.  Never considered Tetris to be the type of game that a VR environment would improve upon.\n",
      "I wish I could afford a VR system. My son has one for his PC. I played it and was totally addicted. I was thinking of getting the one with Playstation 4 if I can ever get enough money. I also want to get Dead Red Redemption 2. I heard a reviewer say it was \"jaw dropping\" good.\n",
      "VR scares me some, especially when designers are trying to get you addidcted\n",
      "I was thinking about how people just sit in chairs hours on end staring straight ahead doing VR. Then I started thinking people used to do that with TV. After coming home from work and eating dinner they would sit in front of the TV staring straight ahead not moving for hours until they went to bed. At least with VR you are moving  your hands and with some games your whole body.\n",
      "Absolutely agree and Tetris is a puzzle game that requires fast thinking, geometric skills, and other brain skills.  The jazz music will also serve to stimulate brain synapsis, so not all bad I guess\n",
      "I was surprised to find out that playing it has positive effects. Like for people suffering from PTSD. Or those trying to stick to diets. I might start playing the original version again until I can get a PS4.\n",
      "That is an interesting fact.  There are a few versions available on Android and Apple devices for free.  But yeah, the VR set up is going to be a super high demand product, especially for the age group that played it as a game boy game\n",
      "I play GTA 5 on my PS3 now. I am really into flight simulators and that one is the best for console I think until I get a PC that can handle one. I can't believe PS3s are researching Black Holes.\n",
      "I was just reading about Tetris selling 495 million copies of of its franchise.  That is enormous\n",
      "I can't believe the original creator didn't get any royalties cause it went to the Soviet Union. I guess it isn't copyrighted cause there are so many free ones now. At least he started getting some royalties in 1996. I don't how with so many free versions out there.\n",
      "Hopefully he will be involved in the VR version and Sony can do the right thing and get him caught up.  Did you see WII Sports is top 3 selling game?  Not sure how that is possible as that game was terrible\n",
      "Actually the new one for Playstation VR was designed by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, the  Japanese designer of the game Rez, which I have never heard of. Do you play any games?\n",
      "I play some mobile games, and some XBox games like Madden and NBA 2K, but not a heavy gamer by any stretch\n",
      "I never did many sports games. Used to love tennis games. I don't follow sports anymore. I am into hiking in the mountains now. I have only had PSs not any XBOXs.\n",
      "Healthy stuff, outdoors, always good.  I worry that VR pulls people away from that\n",
      "If you play mobile games have you heard of ELOH? I play it some. I find it relaxing.  What mobile games do you recommend I try?\n",
      "I like the Clash of Clans genre, Clash Royale ect.  I like the social aspect of playing with others versus solo\n",
      "Sounds good. I don't get all the hype about Candy Crush. Seems boring. I'll check those out. Did you know our Department of Defense used a bunch of Playstation 3s to build a supercomputer?\n",
      "Wow, interesting factoid\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you? Are you a fan of movies? \n",
      "I enjoy movies.     \"Jurassic World\" is an interesting film.\n",
      "I have not seen it. I saw the original film in the 90s and enjoyed it immensely.\n",
      "I have not seen the second one, although I have heard Fallen Kingdom is pretty good.\n",
      "Ok, I guess I should check them out. I like the stuff that Spielberg does. He has a talent for telling stories. I think that Michael Crichton also told good stories.\n",
      "True.    Did you know an elephant can roar, and they used that in the movies!\n",
      "I have heard elephant roars. Must be pretty scary in person. A great sound effect!\n",
      "Yes.    I wonder what they might've done had they gone with the original plan of human-raptor hybrid soldiers!\n",
      "I think that would be great! We could invade countries with our raptor army! We could stop the terrorists. We could conquer Mars.\n",
      "I think that's a different movie!    Then again, dinosaurs in the movie were mostly cretaceous era.\n",
      "I guess that the era determines the creatures. I don't really know dinosaurs well. There was a guy from a TV show in the film, right? Chris Pratt?\n",
      "Yes.   Chris Pratt was in the NBC Sitcom Parks and Recreation.\n",
      "Oh, yeah,that's the TV show. He is very funny. I like his character. He comes off as stupid but I think that he is quite clever.\n",
      "He was nominated for best supporting Actor in a comedy series in 2013\n",
      "He was? He deserved it. I wonder who won. Pratt got cheated. Didn't he used to work at a restaurant?\n",
      "I don't know, but he was a fan of food and had to lose 30 pounds to land a film role!\n",
      "30 pounds? Wow, he was a big guy. But I guess he made enough money to put all that weight back on. \n",
      "Perhaps, but he is now known as a movie star and they cannot really be heavy!    He even came close to being Captain Kirk.\n",
      "He would be a pretty good Kirk. He should be on Star Trek. Or Star Wars. Or Star Trek Wars. \n",
      "I think he is happier with his role in Guardians of the Galaxy.\n",
      "Ah, yes. The GotG. That looks like a fun film. Thanks for the chat.\n",
      "You too.    I think I'm going to go watch Chris Pratt in Moneyball!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi, do you like movies?\n",
      "I do, but right now I'm watching a show called Westworld, have you seen it? \n",
      "I actually have not but I like Jurassic World\n",
      "Well, it is pretty good. It stars Evan rachel Wood, she plays a character named Delores. \n",
      "Cool maybe I should check it out and see if I like it\n",
      "Yeah, it is pretty good. But I don't like it better than Jurassic Park. \n",
      "Have you seen the Fallen KIngdom?\n",
      "No, what is it about? \n",
      "it is the fifth film in the series. did you know dinosaurs in the jurassic park only appear for 15 min in the film?\n",
      "Crazy, but i can believe that. At least in the first one. \n",
      "Yeah. do you know how much the jurassic park ride cost?\n",
      "Yeah, it cost $63 million to make the movie, but $110 million for the ride! \n",
      "go figure. do you know how the raptors in jurassica park were made?\n",
      "Yeah, they had humans inside of suits. Hilarious! \n",
      "hahah yeah that is. did you know it took 6 hours to render one frame of the rain soaked t-rex?\n",
      "Yeah, I saw that. Hilarious. Did you know that there is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans? \n",
      "I would want to know what that is, I am curious about it\n",
      "Me too. But I'm not sure what frequency it is. Kind of has me worried now! \n",
      "well maybe we will find out at some point. did you know we can grow a rib in 2-3 months\n",
      "No, that is shocking. How do they know that? \n",
      "They must have done some study, good for us though. nice chat\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, have you ever thought about the moon?\n",
      "Hello,  yes,  I hear moon dust cute through kevlar like material \n",
      "A type of hay fever?\n",
      "No.  Kevlar,  is a really strong material,  usually used in protective gear,  like helmets or protective clothing. \n",
      "I see.  Did you know we almost put a UN flag instead of a US flag up there?\n",
      "Yeah lol thats funny.  I hear the highest point on the moon is 1938 meters higher than mt everest. \n",
      "Wow that blows my mind.  I wonder if it was formed from an asteroid impact?\n",
      "Not sure.  Mars moon is 1/3 hollow\n",
      "And there is more than one there!\n",
      "More than one what?\n",
      "More than one moon other than Phobos.\n",
      "yes there is 2,  phobos and deimos. \n",
      "how about the methane bases life believed on titan?\n",
      "what about it?\n",
      "Do you believe it to be true?  A moon of Saturn can have life?\n",
      "I dont know,  since im not sure what methane base life really means lol \n",
      "Ahh, me neither.  I hear life and I only know of earth for now that is.  \n",
      "Do you like violin?\n",
      "I do, love the sound of a fiddle!\n",
      "I hear there is a violin that is made out of stone and is fully playable\n",
      "Wow. my neck would hurt though haha.  Nice talking to you, take care\n",
      "Great chat, thanks. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello There. Do you happen to be a Marvel/Warner Brothers fan? \n",
      "Not particularly. I am not too into superheroes. How about you?\n",
      "I really am.  It is very interesting to me how developed many of the characters are.  I also love to look up facts about the various movies.  Such as the fact that \"Wonder Woman\" was the highest grossing origin movie.\n",
      "That's pretty cool. I didn't know that Gal Gadot, the new wonder woman, served two years as a soldier in the israel defense forces.\n",
      "I didn't know that either.  Nor did I know that Beauty and the Beast were also up there for grossing income.  I love also the way that the movies also work in true science\n",
      "Very cool. Gal gadot was unaware she was auditioning for wonder woman. she thought she would be testing for catwoman.\n",
      "I also did not know that Warner Brothers was trying to work out a Superman cameo for the new \"Aquaman\" movie.  I bet Gal Gadot would be good for the new supergirl origin movie they are planning.\n",
      "That would be cool. I didn't know Superman was first published way back in 1938!\n",
      "Wow that is true I believe it was April 18 the book was first published correct? I am also fascinated that Superman once wielded Thor's hammer. \n",
      "Thats neat. Dc comics paid $130 in 1938 for exclusive rights to superman.\n",
      "Yes they did.  I did not know that Jon Cena was in any of the Warner Brothers Movies.  \n",
      "I didn't know that either! I also didn't know that wonderwoman was made the secretary of the justice society when she first appeared in 1941. \n",
      "That I actually did know.  I like all the \"stars\" that are playing these roles now a days but I strongly feel that Christopher Reeve will always be the best superman especially since he gave new life to the role in the 70s. \n",
      "Aww yeah, he was great. 2017 was the first year since 1958 that the top 3 grossing films were led by females! Pretty cool. \n",
      "That is pretty cool, though I wish it hadn't been almost 50 years! I did not know that Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster originally created superman, one has the believe they are millionaires by now.  \n",
      "I'm sure! The writers for superman did not name their super-villain after a pre-existing word - they actually coined the term \"brainiac.\".\n",
      "That is so interesting.  Kind of works since Henry Cavil almost missed the call for the role of superman since he was playing \"World of Warcraft\".  When I think of that game I think of the word \"brainiac\"\n",
      "Haha. Too funny! Did you know that In sweden, it is illegal to name your child metallica, superman, veranda, ikea and elvis? \n",
      "I did actually know that. With all these superheroes it does make one wonder if the universe does have superheroes somewhere since most of the universe is still unknown. \n",
      "That is a good point! I didn't know there are stars in the universe cool enough for humans to touch!\n",
      "I did not know that either.  I also did not know that there is thought that the universe is one bight super hologram.\n",
      "Some people also think there is only one electron in the universe. Hard to believe that one!\n",
      "It is hard to believe.  Also that we haven't seen all of the observable universe\n",
      "True. Thanks for chatting!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi, so you like superman?\n",
      "I like some of the Superman movies, but I've been a little disappointed with them as of late. I've heard that DC is shifting their movies a little\n",
      "do you know how much they paid for the right to superman?\n",
      "Only $130 back in 1938, but who did they buy the rights from? \n",
      "I am thinking maybe it was from Marvel\n",
      "Or maybe it was from the original writer and artist Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. Still, Superman has been popular for a long time\n",
      "yeah he has for sure. do you know henry cavill ?\n",
      "He was the most recent Superman. Some think he won't be making any more movies with DC\n",
      "Yeah and he almost missed the call for superman\n",
      "I guess DC has more hope in continuing Aquaman then they do in doing any future Superman Movies with Cavill\n",
      "do you know how they named the villain?\n",
      "I'm not sure, but I don't think the name existed before they used it\n",
      "yeah that is true. they made it up, brainiac\n",
      "It's illegal to name your child Superman in Sweden. You also can't use the names Elvis, IKEA, Metallica, or Veranda. I think that shows what they deem important\n",
      "wow that is interesting. did you watch wonder woman?\n",
      "I did, and it was a great movie! It's no wonder that it's the highest-grossing superhero movie\n",
      "yeah and also the highest grossing WWI movie too\n",
      "Gal Gadot, who plays Wonder Woman, didn't even know which role she was auditioning for. She thought it was for the role of Catwoman\n",
      "yeah, that is funny how she got it anyways\n",
      "It might be because she's good for the role. I wonder if her ability to do it well has to two with the two years she served in the Israel defense forces as a soldier\n",
      "I bet it does a lot actually. nice chat\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello,  how are you?  Do you like DC? Dc comics paid $130 in 1938 for exclusive rights to superman.\n",
      "I am not that into superheros, but I recently heard that there is most likely going to be a new actor playing Superman. \n",
      "That's a bummer,  I love Henry Cavill as Superman.  Henry cavill almost missed the call for the role of superman cause he was playing \"world of warcraft\"\n",
      "Unbelievable! The most successful DCEU release in North America was Wonder Woman. \n",
      "Thats crazy lol And, The writers for superman did not name their super-villain after a pre-existing word - they actually coined the term \"brainiac.\"\n",
      "That's pretty cool. Superman gained the ability to fly at the request of fleischer studios because animating his repeated jumps was too difficult.\n",
      "Haha,  but didn't he already know how to fly? In sweden, it is illegal to name your child metallica, superman, veranda, ikea and elvis.\n",
      "Right?! That's interesting. There was a version of superman created where superman was raised in the soviet union.\n",
      "Oh weird.  Superman once wielded thor's hammer. not because he was a super-man but because he was \"worthy\".\n",
      "Neat! Marvel comics creator stan lee wrote 15 dc comics, re-imagining popular superheroes like batman and superman.\n",
      "That was probably a good call.  They look way more metal now. Gal gadot, the new wonder woman, served two years as a soldier in the israel defense forces. \n",
      "That's awesome! The lego movie was the first ever feature film with wonder woman in it.\n",
      "whoa thats an interesting one!  Gal gadot was unaware she was auditioning for wonder woman. she thought she would be testing for catwoman\n",
      "It worked out in her favor! When wonder woman first appeared as a member of the justice society in 1941, the group made her their secretary.\n",
      "omg lol she has super powers and you make her a secretary lol With (star wars: the last jedi, beauty and the beast, wonder woman) 2017 was the first year since 1958 (south pacific, auntie mame, cat on a hot tin roof) that the top 3 highest grossing domestic films were female led.\n",
      "Seriously! The inventor of the lie detector test, william moulton marston, also created wonder woman, who wields the lasso of truth.\n",
      "Ahhhhhh interesting!  \n",
      "There is a silver coin with superman on the heads side that is legal tender in canada.\n",
      "Lucky Canada!  \n",
      "On april 1st, 2015, the smithsonian had a special one day viewing of wonder woman's invisible jet. Hahaha.\n",
      "hahaha thats hilarious!  good talking to you. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi how are you? do you like the moon?\n",
      "Hi, I love the moon!! I love to watch a full moon\n",
      "I dont usually pay attention to it, but it has shaped so much of human culture.\n",
      "It has, but the earth is not the only planet with a moon, Mars has a moon named phobos\n",
      "Many planets have moons. ours is synchronized so that it always shows the same face to us.\n",
      "Do you know what the highest point of the moon is?\n",
      "I have no idea. i cant imagine that it is that high. the earth is much bigger.\n",
      "It is 1938 mts higher than Mt Everest\n",
      "Whoa. that is high. i wouldnt want to climb that, even in low gravity. if you fall, you could die.\n",
      "It looks like they wanted to put a UN flag instead of an american flag on the moon! but regardless we cannot see it\n",
      "yeah, i heard that the flag would be bleached white after all the radiation hitting it. soon the chinese will have flags everywhere \n",
      "That is probably true! Hey , do you like music?\n",
      "i love music. what kind of music do you like?\n",
      "I love all kinds of music, especially rock, I like to play the bass and would like to play violin! \n",
      "That is great! the bass is a great instrument. every band needs a bass player. the violin is a fussy instrument though.\n",
      "I found interesting that Einstein played the violin and the piano really well!\n",
      "the creative, intellectual mind needs many outlets, including creative ones.\n",
      "He said that great scientists are also great artists!\n",
      "Yes, but great artists are not great scientists! why is that? anyway, great chat!\n",
      "Yes so much to talk about, music, astronomy.. It has been great I agree!\n",
      "Have a good night!\n",
      "You too!!\n",

      "I really enjoy writing poetry - I can relate to poets of centuries ago\n",
      "Hi, that's cool.  Do you enjoy reading it as well?\n",
      "I do.  I love the Iliad and the Odyssey - even studied those when I lived in Italy.\n",
      "Wow!  I remember reading Edgar Allan Poe's, The Raven, while I was in school and being shocked when I found out, he only got paid $9 for it.\n",
      "Wow that is not very much money!   I wonder if Demetri Martin got anything for his 224 word palindrome poem!\n",
      "I would hope he did.  You know that had to be very hard to do!\n",
      "For sure.  But there is another poem which when read normally is depressing, but is inspiring when read backwards!\n",
      "How awesome, I'll have to try and read that when I get the time.  \n",
      "Yes and study some Javanese - if you read their alphabet in order you get another poem!\n",
      "Cool, I didn't know that either.  They must be a very poetic people in Java?\n",
      "I think so.  I believe they are big on the violin there too - did you know there is a violin made of stone that is playable?\n",
      "Wow, fully playable and out of stone.  That must be a gifted violin maker.\n",
      "Yes.  Techniques have improved a lot over the years.  Modern violins are preferred over Stradivarious when there are blind sound tests\n",
      "And here I thought the Stradivarious were the best sounding in the world?  My hairdresser plays violin and she's pretty good on it, but I hear Albert Einstein was a gifted on the violin as well as the piano.\n",
      "Yes he thought that the greatest scientists are artists as well\n",
      "It makes sense to me.  Funny my hairdresser refers to it as a fiddle when sh'e jamming with the local Bluegrass boys, but when her symphony friends are in town, she calls it a violin!\n",
      "Larry of the 3 Stooges was great at the violin as well!\n",
      "Yeah, I had heard he burned himself very badly with acid when he was little and he used the violin lessons to strengthen the damaged parts of his arm.\n",
      "Yes if it had not been for WW1 he would have gone to a european music conservatory\n",
      "Good thing he didn't.  We probably wouldn't have had the three stooges movies.  They were so funny to watch as a kid.\n",
      "I was never a big fan.  I was more into science stuff like watching people go to the moon.\n",
      "That's cool too.  Well it's been fun chatting with you.  Enjoy the rest of your day!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hello, do you like poetry?\n",
      "I do enjoy poetry, what about you?\n",
      "Some of it yes.  I recently discovered that there is a poem that is depressing,  but if you read it backwards it is actually inspiring. \n",
      "Woah a lot of talent, do you like Edgar Allan Poe?\n",
      "yes I like him. \n",
      "Do you know his poem The Raven? its really famous, I bet you do\n",
      "Yes,  I have heard that poem before,  very dark,  interesting.  Do you like that poem?\n",
      "I like it its one of my favorites, dark but so interesting, well cool fact about that poem is that it was sold for only $9 dollars\n",
      "That is a shame,  its definitely the most popular one of his.  \n",
      "It is a shame he got a really bad deal, there are many poems about the moon, the moon sure is a beautiful astronomical body\n",
      "Yes,  the largest moon on Mars is 1/3 hollow! weird. \n",
      "Really? it must be really cool as well I wonder if the moon dust over there is also dangerous.\n",
      "Probably,  moon hay fever doesnt sound good. \n",
      "Doesnt sound good at all I agree, did you hear about the apollo 11 mission and how NASA wanted to place a UN flag instead of an American flag in the moon?\n",
      "lol Yeah,  thats funny.  I hear there is evidence of methane based life on the moon of saturn. \n",
      "Woah, thats so cool I wonder if we will ever find smart life in another planet, maybe there's intelligent life in Mars already and they are hiding from our telescopes. \n",
      "Maybe.  Have you seen that movie about Mars having life on it?  It was a scary movie. \n",
      "I didn't but I bet it was a scary movie on another note do you know how to play the violin?\n",
      "No I never learned how,  do you?\n",
      "No not really I think its really hard but its a nice instrument I would like to learn how to play it some day.\n",
      "I am more of a piano person. \n",
      "The piano is also great but I like violin or fiddle as many call it, it's been a great chat, I enjoyed talking with you\n",
      "Same to you , thanks for the chat! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you like superhero movies?\n",
      "i love them\n",
      "Superman first appeared in a comic book in 1938\n",
      "And DC comics paid $130 in 1938 for exclusive rights to superman.\n",
      "That's a bargain! It's illegal to name your child Superman in Sweden. \n",
      "i know that's crazy! Superman is one the most lucrative superhero franchises \n",
      "Henry cavill almost missed the call for the role of superman cause he was playing \"world of warcraft\"\n",
      "what about wonder woman do u like those movies \n",
      "They're ok. Not only is wonder woman the highest-grossing superhero origin movie, it is also the highest-grossing wwi movie.\n",
      "i didnt know that new wonderwoman served 2 years as asoldier in the israel defense\n",
      "That's pretty cool. Wonder Woman first appeared as a member of the Justice Society in 1941.\n",
      "And she thought she was getting the role of cat woman. She didn't know she was auditioning for wonder woman .\n",
      "Too funny! Wonder Woman appeared in 2016 in Batman vs. Superman, too. \n",
      "So let's talk about the universe. There are scientists who theorize that universes evolve through natural selection much like different species do on earth\n",
      "That's interesting! The Universe is all of space and time and their contents, including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy. \n",
      "ah , and what about this , the universe might be one giant superhologram\n",
      "Freaky! There is a region of space that may be pulling galaxies outside the observable universe.\n",
      "There's a theory that there is only one electron in the universe, i would like to read more about that.\n",
      "Me too! Thanks for chatting, I learned a lot!\n",
      "me too ! im actually going to look for more information about the universe later today , have a nice day\n",
      "You too! \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, do you like the movie Batman?\n",
      "I sure do. Do you know what is was originally based on?\n",
      "I do not know what , what? There were also plans to build a gotham city theme park\n",
      "Cool, the idea was based on Da Vinci's flying machine\n",
      "Wow that is nice. Smallville was also supposed to be about Batman\n",
      "Nice. U of Victoria offers a course on Batman, I want to take it\n",
      "wow me too. Michael Keaton  opposed Batman Forever and did not want to reprise the role\n",
      "Wow, interesting. Do you like comedy?\n",
      "I love it. Did you know Demetri Martin got into Harvard law and dropped out?\n",
      "Wow he must have really liked comedy then and I guess he did pretty well so no regrets there\n",
      "Exactly. Have you heard of bromantic comedies?\n",
      "Hmm I am not sure what those are, are they a special kind of comedy?\n",
      "Yes they are comedies where there are romances between friends like the Hangover\n",
      "That makes a lot of sense. Do you watch comedy central at all?\n",
      "I watch it sometimes, they have some good ones in there\n",
      "Yeah and they have cancelled 100 shows since they came to be in 1989\n",
      "I guess that is not a lot considering how long they have been around\n",
      "That is true actually. Do you know the programming language Python?\n",
      "I have heard of it, is that somehow related to comedy\n",
      "yes, the name comes from a British comedy group, monty python\n",
      "Oh that is pretty sweet, they are immortalized then\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How's it going? Are you a batman fan?  Michael Keaton recently gave a commencement speech at Kent State and ended it by saying \"I'm Batman\" \n",
      "I love the batman movie I think keaton was the best, Bale did a great job though. \n",
      "Yea, better than Val Kilmer, too bad Michael Keaton turned down 15 million to reprise the role in Batman Forever\n",
      "Yeah, that's a lot of money. I think they blacklisted him over that. \n",
      "That sucks, I'm dissapointed Universal Studios never made a real Gotham City\n",
      "Yeah, that definetly would have been cool. In the newer batmans I think they just used NYC. \n",
      "I didn't know that. I guess there is a Russian version of Batman that teams up with the teenage mutant ninja turtles\n",
      "Yeah, that's interesting. Did you watch TMNT when you were younger? \n",
      "Yea I saw the movies although I enjoyed Batman more, I use to watch the 1960's tv show\n",
      "Nice, I watched all of the batman movies. Of them all I liked Batman with Keaton and jack.\n",
      "Yea, I just watched the movies thought, I never read the comics, apparently Stan Lee wrote some re-imagined Batman comics\n",
      "I read that somewhere. I'm not all that familiar with him. I didn't know the Dark Knight Rises made over $1 billion. \n",
      "That is impressive. Do you also like comedy movies? Apparently Kung Fu Hustle is suppose to be very funny, Bill Murray really enjoyed it\n",
      "Murray is a great actor. I've never seen Kung Fu Hustle, have you seen it? \n",
      "\n",
      "No I haven't, it's hard to find online I've heard a lot of good things about it besides Bill Murray calling it \"the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy\"\n",
      "I liked his movies like Caddyshack. Have you seen it? \n",
      "Yea, Caddy Shack was great, so was Ghost Busters, Stripes, and a bunch of others\n",
      "The actor that played Egon from ghostbusters passed away. A shame. \n",
      "Didn't he graduate from Harvard? I know Demetri Martin went to Harvard law before dropping out from boredom\n",
      "I'm not sure, good question. He was also a famous director, that I do know. \n",
      "Yea, he directed Ghostbusters. I got to go but it was nice talking with you\n",
      "Awesome, he was a great comedian. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey there, I was wanting to join the millions and watch the World Cup this year, I think.\n",
      "I wish I could have gone but it was very expensive to travel to Russia, I'll have to wait until it comes to North America.\n",
      "Yea, that is a good point. I dont like flying very much. The United States got 3rd place in the first FIFA World Cup in 1930. Sort of a neat fact.\n",
      "It's slightly surprising that the US Men have never won a World Cup. I know that there are a lot of talented countries but I would have thought they'd have won at least one by now.\n",
      "Yeah, that is amazing because there is a lot of talent.I learned that there are no net economic gains for the countries that have played host to the Olympics, that seems odd.\n",
      "It costs a lot to host an Olympic Games, some countries have part of the infrastructure already but a lot end up building stadiums and arenas that become abandoned after.\n",
      "Oh that is a really good point, I haven't not ever though of it that way before. Totally makes sense.\n",
      "I know that was a problem with Brazil and China recently. Their stadiums are completely out of use now.\n",
      "Oh wow, sort of sad. I also like to follow the player Cristiano Ronaldo the pro footballer from Portugal. \n",
      "Yes he's had a rough couple of months in the headlines recently though.\n",
      "Yeah, I know. I even heard that he was expelled from school for throwing a chair at a teacher. That seems a little extreme.\n",
      "His school probably had a zero tolerance policy, a lot of schools do these days.\n",
      "Thais probably a good rule and very true. I know that he also refuses to get any tattoos on his body in order to be able to donate blood. That seems like a very worthy cause and a good person to do that.\n",
      "Yes he does have a lot of great qualities. I saw an interview where someone attempted to speak Portugese to him that did not speak it naturally. He chastised the other reporters for making fun of that person's attempt.\n",
      "HAHA, nice. I like people to stick up to bullies in the media or anywhere else.\n",
      "I originally did not care much for him because he seemed cocky but that seems to only be on the football field where probably has earned the right to be a little bit of a showboat.\n",
      "Yeah, it would be funny if players had to wear a hat associated with their personality. The most popular hat in history was a bowler hat, not the cowboy hat. \n",
      "It's a lot smaller, I bet it stayed on your head better on a windy day.\n",
      "Yeah, that would help a lot. The origins of a conical party hat that was derived from the dunce caps they were worn at parties to encourage foolish and silly behavior,lol.\n",
      "I've probably earned myself a few dunce caps at parties before!\n",
      "HA, you and me both!\n",
      "It was fun chatting with you today, have a good one!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey there do you ever wear a hat? I'm personally bald so I wear one all the time LOL\n",
      "I think I look funny in them so I don't haha.\n",
      "Haha, well I just think they look good on me, but I know everyone has a different shaped head. I guess that until 1998, British politicians had to wear a top hat, that seems really silly\n",
      "Interesting. I think the Royal Canadian Mounted Police hats look pretty cool.\n",
      "What do those look like? I don't know that I've seen them before. Do you ever watch old western movies? Apparently the bowler cap was more popular than the cowboy hat\n",
      "I guess they are described as peaked or brimmed. I don't think they are protective. They look kind of like a forest ranger hat.\n",
      "Ok I'll have to check those out sometime, do you know what a hairpin is by the way? Do you know the ones that females wear, apparently in 1908 they passed a law to limit their length, they were worried that people use them as Weapons LOL\n",
      "That is pretty cool. I want a weapon hairpin haha. Another cool thing I'd like is a hat and a sword that I'd get if I got my PhD in Finland.\n",
      "Wow that's cool! They should give those out everywhere haha. You know how you can tip your hat? Apparently that started with knights using their face visors, that's pretty cool\n",
      "Interesting! I think we should go back to wearing all sorts of different hats. London black cabs design was originally made to accommodate the height of bowler hats.\n",
      "I agree with you, I don't think people are enough hats these days haha. Did you ever wear a dunce cap before? Apparently the conical party hat was used to encourage foolish behavior and that's how the dunce cap was started\n",
      "Fortunately I have never had to wear a dunce cap. Protective hats are really useful. The plastic made to use legos is the same to make hard hats\n",
      "Yes I agree with you. I also like how hats can have religious functions, there are the miters hats worn by Bishops and turbans that the Sikhs wear\n",
      "I guess chefs hats keep hair out of food but it also has symbolic meaning.\n",
      "That is interesting. Interesting too that soccer players don't need to wear hats LOL, are you going to watch the FIFA World Cup this year\n",
      "No, I am not really into sports. I know that nearly 50 percent of the world watches it though.\n",
      "Yes I agree. I'm not into sports either, and I especially don't like soccer LOL. it is interesting that there is no net economic gain to hosting the world cup, or the Olympics for that matter, I wonder why Country still do it\n",
      "Qatar wanted the world cup to be there and they promised air conditioned stadiums that would reduce the temperature by 20 celsius but also were solar powered.\n",
      "Oh wow interesting. I didn't know that, I know that yes they are doing the 2020 FIFA cup, but the city that is going to host it isn't even built yet apparently? That seems like it's coming up fast LOL\n",
      "Oh, interesting. I did not know they got the bid.\n",
      "Yes they did. Did you know that hungry used to be really good at soccer by the way? Between 1950 and 1956 they had only one defeat? And that was in the World Cup finals\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Politicians in Britain had to wear a top hat in the house of commons, that's hilarious! \n",
      "Really, that's interesting.  It seems almost the opposite of what is expected in America.  Wearing hats inside is usually considered rude.\n",
      "Yea, America is funny when it comes to hats, they even passed a law 100 years ago limiting the length of hatpins so they couldn't be used as a weapon\n",
      "We have such silly customs when it comes to hats.  Think about the mortarboard we wear for graduation.  Who thought that silly thing up.\n",
      "I don't know, I read that conical party hats were derived from dunce caps\n",
      "And were you aware that in the old west, it wasn't the cowboy hat that was the most popular, but actually the bowler hat.\n",
      "That's crazy, I don't even think I've seen a bowler hat, must not be that cool if they weren't in the movies\n",
      "I never put much thought into it, but I guess hats have all kinds of various functions, such as protection from weather, religious reasons, and of course to be fashionable.\n",
      "Yea, Knights wore hats and helmets to protect themselves in battle\n",
      "I guess a helmet could be considered a type of hat.  I never thought about it that way.  Why do you think police wear hats?  It isn't protecting much, and the Royal Canadian Police have the goofiest looking hats there are\n",
      "I don't know, maybe to keep the sun out their eyes or rain \n",
      "That's true.  Does it get sunny in Canada?  I just assumed it was all covered in snow all the time.  Haha.  \n",
      "I don't know, they do play a lot of hockey and when 3 goals are scored by one player it's called a hat trick\n",
      "It seems like people don't wear hats as often these days as they used to many years ago.  Like when you see a movie about england hundreds of years ago and all the rich people wore hats.  Maybe it was like a status symbol of sorts back then.\n",
      "Yea, I know rich people like to tip their hats which started  from medieval knights \n",
      "Oh really?  That is an interesting origin of that custom.  Do people still tip their hats to each other?\n",
      "Sometimes just to be funny mostly\n",
      "You know who else wears hats, chefs.  Well, at least in the movies.  I don't know if I have ever seen a chef actually wearing a hat while cooking.  \n",
      "Baseball players wear hats too\n",
      "True, hence baseball caps which are popular with everyone these days, but they do seem to serve a function with baseball players.\n",
      "That is true, I think I'm gonna head to the mall to look for a new hat, nice talking with you\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi there, do you wear hats at all?\n",
      "I do wear a hat sometimes as protection against the sun and weather.\n",
      "Nice. Did you know British politicians in order to make a point in the house of commons had to wear a top hat?\n",
      "That is funny.  I always thought they wore a wig.  Chefs have their own style of hats as well called the Toque.\n",
      "I guess everyone has some sort of a hat to wear. APparently the most popular hat used to be the bowler one, not the cowboy hat in the old west\n",
      "And don't forget the styles that Catholic Bishops wear or the Sikh Turbans\n",
      "Yup for sure. DO you know how the whole thing about tipping the hat originated?\n",
      "No how did that start?  I think its funny that London cabs have the design they do to accomodate hats!\n",
      "That is a good one. It came from the Knights back in the day who raised their visors to show friendliness\n",
      "That makes sense.  I wonder whether they had PhD's?  In Finland when you get your degree you get a top hat and a sword!\n",
      "Nice, sounds so royal. Switching topics here, do you watch soccer at all?\n",
      "I usually only watch the World cup  - I don't follow it day to day, just the championships\n",
      "Nice. Do you know where the 2022 one is taking place?\n",
      "I believe in Qatar - even though it is crazy hot there.  Japan made a bid for it however.\n",
      "Yeah but it seems the city where it will take place does not exist as of yet. Maybe they are building it still\n",
      "That is pretty crazy - though if 46% of the Global Population watch the world cup, then it should be able to raise some money!\n",
      "I know so I do not understand how the host countries do not make any money off of it. \n",
      "Yes you would think they would.  Did you know that there was once a group that ended with a 4-way tie?  Wonder how that got resolved?\n",
      "Wow, that is too complicated, maybe they just had to keep playing each other. US team does not seems to be doing really well though, except for the women's team \n",
      "Yes the Womens team has done really well.  New Zealand did great in 2010 - they went undefeated!\n",
      "That is pretty cool. DO you have a favorite soccer player?\n",
      "I really like Cristiano Ronaldo.  He is probably the best player in the world.\n",
      "I think as of right now he certainly is. Nice chatting with you\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How' it going, Do you like the Lion King? It was the first Disney film dubbed into Zulu\n",
      "Yes I watched the Lion King several times, I like the song by Elton John.\n",
      "I heard Frozen had a lot of good songs, plus it's the first female directed disney movie\n",
      "I wanted to see Frozen, but never get around to see it, I saw commercials.\n",
      "Have you've seen Wreck-it-Ralph? It originally started production in the 1980s\n",
      "Yes I saw most of it, but not the end, I enjoyed Wreck-it-Ralph, the part I saw.\n",
      "It got great reviews, I wonder if the toy industry go involved with it's production like they do with other disney movies\n",
      "I would think so, did you know Star Wars was the second highest grossing film at all time.\n",
      "Which one, the original 1977 movie or one of it's sequels?\n",
      "I am not positive, but I think the original 1977.\n",
      "Yea that one is my favorite. It's crazy the entire Star Wars franchise is worth 65 billion \n",
      "Wow yes, I remember it was one of the most popular and high rated movie that brought in millions.\n",
      "Marcia Lucas did a great job making changes to George's original scripts and made the movies better\n",
      "Yes you are right, I wasn't familiar with Marcia Lucas as I was with George Lucas. \n",
      "I wonder how much money she made since George got to keep the licensing and merchandising rights of Star Wars\n",
      "I can't imagine, I wonder why disney recycled a lot of their animation frames? \n",
      "Probably to save money, I guess reusing frames would save Disney time too\n",
      "Yes I agree with you, have you seen Return of the Jedi the film of 1983, If yes did you like it?\n",
      "Yea, the ending to Return of the Jedi was good but I found the other parts boring\n",
      "Have you ever read the book, I got more from the book than I got from the movie, that was king of odd for me, because I don't take time to read that much/\n",
      "No I've never read the book. Well I got to go, nice talking with you\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a Star Wars fan?\n",
      "yes, i really like the original trilogy. You?\n",
      "Me too, it was so good! George Lucas became a billionaire because of it\n",
      "Yeah, he was clever. he knew the value of merchandising right. he traded away some cash for a huge bonanza.\n",
      "For sure, then sold it to Disney for even more money lol!\n",
      "i dont know how much money he has now but it must be in the billions. good for him. he needed to move on.\n",
      "For sure, now sit on your island and enjoy all that money. His wife won awards from those movies\n",
      "His wife was a real help for him on the first film. great ideas and great editing.\n",
      "For sure, I think she won an academy award for that editing!\n",
      "Yeah, i bet george had mixed feelings about that one. he never got an oscar, but he got billions. oh well.\n",
      "yikes, that would give me mixed feelings lol. Did you ever hear what James Earl Jones made for voicing vader?\n",
      "I dont think he was paid a lot, but he probably got royalties or something.\n",
      "For sure, I think it was like 7500 dollars, but royalties added up too \n",
      "Yeah, he probably got a ton on the next two movies. he was key to the drama.\n",
      "I agree lol. Speaking of space movies, did you like Guardians of the Galaxy?\n",
      "I never saw it, though i heard good things. quite funny.\n",
      "It was really good. A different type of marvel movie which was great\n",
      "I like the comedy ones. i am not really into explosions and fight scenes. they get old.\n",
      "That is a good point, seeing it once was good enough to like. It was so nice chatting with you!\n",
      "Yeah, i enjoyed chatting! Have a good day!\n",
      "Thanks enjoy your day also!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Hello, not sure if you have heard about this or not but I find it fascinating. Hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests.\n",
      "Hi! No I did not know that. Very interesting.\n",
      "It is! Something else I recently learned about birds is that, most birds bones are so hollow that the entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers! I didn't think there was much of anything that could weigh less than a feather or even multiple feathers together!\n",
      "wow...never knew that. did you know crows can mimic humans?\n",
      "I did not know that, actually. But, speaking of of birds being able to mimc, there are wild birds in australia that can mimic the sound of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws! I thought parrots could only do things like this!\n",
      "i know how crazy! nature is amazing!\n",
      "It is. And, check this out! There are some birds that fly from Alaska to northern Mexico without sleeping when migrating. I do not even see how that could be possible!\n",
      "Me either. I would need lots more rest. \n",
      "Same here! And, while on the subject of birds, I recently learned that all birds have wings except for the extinct moa and elephant birds. I wonder how they are even considered birds since they do not have wings? Strange!\n",
      "Very strange! I also wonder how they classify that that way. Do you like bird watching.\n",
      "I am not a huge fan but I do like to bird watch from time to time. How about you?\n",
      "I am not either. do you plan on watching the oscars.\n",
      "Yes, I do! I just hope it is not hosted by Jimmy Kimmel again. Do you plan on watching?\n",
      "yes if i can remember the day. will you have a viewing party?\n",
      "Usually just watch it by myself. What does a viewing party consist of exactly?\n",
      "having people to watch and having lots of food usuallly a theme to the movies.\n",
      "That sounds like tons of fun. Were you aware that the Oscars is also know as The Academy Awards? I was not aware of this until I read it a few days ago.\n",
      "Yes. I did know that. They should just stick to one name. There are several movies up for best picture. Have you seen any of them?\n",
      "Yes, they should. And, no, I haven't seen what movies are up for best picture. Which ones are they?\n",
      "The Post, Shape of Water, Dunkirk, Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri, Lady Bird, Phantom Thread, Call me by your name, get out, I think that is it.\n",
      "Awesome, those are some good ones! I can't wait for it to come on! Hope you have a good time watching and if you have a viewing party I hope it turns out well. Have a great day!\n",
      "You too thanks\n",
      "Thanks!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you host an Oscar's party?\n",
      "not usually, did you know there are recipes for each nominee for best picture?\n",
      "I've heard that.  Like deviled eggs for The Shape of Water.\n",
      "Hi, thats good,  some places make spaghetti and meatballs as party food, that seems odd to me\n",
      "Me too as it is so messy to eat!  Ruined clothing.  I like the Hard Cider Rarebit for Dunkirk myself.\n",
      "I was just thinking that a cheese board would be more my speed.\n",
      "You'd probably not mind Winston Churchill's favorite drink, the martini though.\n",
      "That would be good, did you know they make \"toast bites\" at Oscar parties but to make them sound impressive, they call them Tartines?\n",
      "No, I didn't know that.  Walt Disney holds the record for the most Oscars, 22!\n",
      "I believe he first won for Snow White in 1938\n",
      "I was surprised to learn that Tom Hanks refuses to play bad guys in films.\n",
      "Good for him, I kinda think playing a bad guy might be fun.  he has made many films, what is your fav?\n",
      "I liked the one about the man who went to the desert kingdom to sell technology though I don't recall the title.  I really liked Cast Away and Captain Phillips too.\n",
      "I love the rom coms, like Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail.  Were there any you didn't like?\n",
      "I wasn't crazy about Cloud Atlas.  I didn't know he always ends his emails with a pun.\n",
      "I didn't know that about his emails, I didn't like that one either.  Crazy that he has been making movies since 1984.\n",
      "He's never made a movie with a bird as a prominent feature has he?\n",
      "Not that I know of, did you know that Ravens are the only birds to make up after a fight with other Ravens?\n",
      "No, and did you know hummingbirds use spider webs to construct their nests?\n",
      "That is interesting, did you know that while birds are not considered mammals, Pigeons produce mile for their young?\n",
      "That I didn't know.  Great chatting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good morning how are you today?\n",
      "Im good. Do you like tom hanks? he refuses to play bad guy roles. I could never see him as a bad guy!\n",
      "I like Tom Hanks, and it would be hard to see him as a bad guy but I think he could do it. Do you have a favorite movie of his?\n",
      "hmmm im unsure. but I did just see saving Mr banks the other day and he played a good walt disney. and apparently hes the first actor ever to do that in a mainstream movie\n",
      "Wow I didn't know that. Did you know he has over $8.5 of film earnings?\n",
      "billion! hes the highest all time box office star and I can totally see that. And he did it while being pretty wholesome and loveable\n",
      "Yes billion thank you. It is pretty amazing that he did while staying wholesome given today's sex, nudity and violence in films.\n",
      "hes so nice that he refunded an unhappy couples movie tickets because they didnt like thomas crowne \n",
      "That was nice. Do you know who holds the record for most oscars under his name?\n",
      "I believe that. eminem has oscars too. although he isnt even in the same league as tom lol\n",
      "Very true. Did you know the Dodo bird is related to the pigeon?\n",
      "I dont even know what a do do bird looks like. some birds fly from alaska to mexico without sleeping. i will never complain about lack of sleep again,lol\n",
      "I agree, talk about your jet lag. Did you know that Hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct their nests?\n",
      "I do now! most birds bones are so hollow that they way less than the feathers\n",
      "I guess they have to be to let them fly. Some people think that birds developed from dinosaurs. Do you believe that? \n",
      "Yes I do.\n",
      "Me to. You can actually picture some birds today as being miniature dinosaurs. dinosaurs.\n",
      "especially the way weve seen them portrayed in movies.there are wild birds in australia that can mimic sounds like cameras, car alarms etc\n",
      "That's amazing. I knew someone who owned a bird that could imitate his dishwasher.\n",
      "lol . can it unload and load the dishwasher too?! \n",
      "Ha, that would be nice wouldn't it?\n",
      "good talk\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello.  What do you think about Tom Hanks, as an actor?\n",
      "Hi, I love Tom Hanks as an actor and a comedian. He's such a good guy and actually refuses to play bad guy roles in films. \n",
      "Apparently, Tom Hanks can always end his emails with a pun.\n",
      "Cool. Tom Hanks personally refunded the price of a couple's cinema tickets after they expressed disappointment for Larry Crowne.\n",
      "That was nice of him.  I did not know that Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office star.\n",
      "Yes, he is. With over $8.5 billion world wide firm earnings, he's the man.\n",
      "That was amazing.  I always know that he is a good actor but I did not know that he was that good.\n",
      "Yes, Tom Hanks in \"Saving Mr. Banks\" is the first ever actor to play Walt Disney in a mainstream film.\n",
      "Yes, I know.  He is so talented.  He also voices Sheriff Woody in the Toy Story film series.\n",
      "Yes, I love most of his movies. I really loved Big, Cast Away, Apollo 13, You've Got Mail, and Sleepless In Seattle. I'm going to have to catch up on his newer movies.\n",
      "I love him in You've Got Mail.  I want to watch that movie again.\n",
      "Me too. I want to see Saving Mr. Banks. I did see most of The Green Mile but I will have to watch that one again, too.  I really loved him in Splash with Daryl Hannah.\n",
      "Are you familiar with Academy Awards (aka the Oscars)?\n",
      "Yes, I've seen a few throughout the years. I remember back in the day, Blazing Saddles was nominated for 3 Oscars.\n",
      "They give 24 awards to talented people in the film industry annually.  \n",
      "Yes, Did you know that Daniel Day-Lewis is the only actor to win Best Actor at the Oscars 3 times.\n",
      "No, I did not know that.  Thanks for the info.  I always like to know the facts related to the entertainment industry.\n",
      "Yes, and Walt Disney to this day holds the record for most Oscars won by a man with 22 Oscars under his name.\n",
      "Wow, that was amazing.  The Oscars were nominated for nine emmys in 2013. \n",
      "Yes, and Eminem has more Oscars than Leonardo DiCaprio, Johnny Depp, Will Smith, George Lucas, and Bill Murray combined. That's a lot.\n",
      "I was surprised to hear about Eminem getting Oscars awards - I thought that the Oscar people would not like the language he uses in his songs.  I was more surprised that he got more awards than Leonardo and Johnny Depp.\n",
      "Me too. Who would've thought? Nice chatting with you, have a good one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi how are you? do you like movies?\n",
      "Yea, I really like the Lion King, it is the first Disney movie to be dubbed in Zulu\n",
      "thats great! im glad they did that. didnt they make a live action version of it?\n",
      "They're suppose to make one soon. Did you know that Wreck-it Ralph started development all the way back in the 80s\n",
      "that is amazing. i guess the arcade games in the movie date back to then, so it makes sense.\n",
      "Yea, it's a shame though that the toy industry has such a large influence on Disney movies\n",
      "yes, every dollar must be squeezed out of a product. the films become giant commercial for a toy sales campaign. then the fast food is involved too.\n",
      "Yea, plus sometimes the film makers reuse animation frames.\n",
      "Yes, I bet they try to do that to reduce costs. Animation, the good stuff, is really expensive. Many of those beautiful films took many hours to make. Even with computers now it's intense.\n",
      "It's a shame they just use computers now, I bet wreck it ralph was originally hand drawn\n",
      "probably. i think that the style is different. i like the hand drawn, but usually im interested in the story. i dont watch a lot of animation though.\n",
      "Yea me neither, I do like the old Star Wars movies released from 1977-1983\n",
      "i like those too. i dont like the new ones because of all the graphics. the CGI is not a story. it supports a story. if the story is weak, then cgi cant save it.\n",
      "Yea plus Marcia Lucas really made the story of the original trilogy better\n",
      "She had a good understanding of the story. George needs guidance on such things. he is creative but needs others to shape his ideas.\n",
      "Yea, maybe he stopped caring after making billions from the licensing and merchandise from Star Wars\n",
      "he probably has to suffer the rest of his life with his billions and no oscar. \n",
      "Yea, and watching the new movies. I wonder what he thinks of Guardians of the Galaxy, James Gunn did a good job writing the screenplay\n",
      "i havent seen it. i know that it is based ona comic book. i usually dont watch those films. Anyway, great chat!\n",
      "Yea you too. I think I might catch guardians of the galaxy or as it's known in China \"Interplanetary Unusual Attack Team\"\n",
      "That's an interesting name! LOL Have a good evening.\n",
      "You too\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey there my friend do you ever wear shoes.\n",
      "Yes I do but not like ballet dancers.  They can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week. \n",
      "That is shocking. I used to date a ballet dancer actually. And I can confirm that they always have feet problems\n",
      "I imagine... Did she put dry tea bags in her shoes to absorb any odors?  I've heard that works. \n",
      "I should have had her do that. No she didn't but she did not have smelly feet either. I will have to put that in my memory banks to try on myself haha\n",
      "Me too... Did you know someone found 5,000 year old shoes that perform better than modern shoes?  I wonder if Nike is on that...\n",
      "Wow maybe they have a pet done that. I would love to try those shoes on. Did you know Stephon Marbury helped to promote a line of shoes that was only $15\n",
      "Yep. Did you know that during a G20 summit, Russia gave delegates thumb drives? They were probably bugged somehow. \n",
      "That's really crazy. It doesn't surprise me that Russia would do that dough. And yes I guess it had Trojan viruses on them. Very strange that some it's only began around the year 1955 with the Geneva Summit\n",
      "Yeah and Spain is the only country that has been a permanent guest at every G20 summit. \n",
      "That is really weird of them. I wonder why they would not request official membership? Have you heard of the game Eve online\n",
      "Dunno.  Maybe they feel that they are a guaranteed member.\n",
      "Well it's an online computer game. I guess they apparently have World summits and they received the world Summit award from the United Nations\n",
      "Did you know that when/if you turn 100 in Japan, the PM sends you a silver cup?\n",
      "That's really cool. It's nice that it comes from the Prime Minister too. Also so many people were turning 100 they had to find a way to make a cheaper cup haha\n",
      "Yep.  I can't believe that in 1995 a radio station successfully prank called Queen Elizabeth I.  I bet someone got fired over that. \n",
      "Oh definitely! I love that the prime minister of the UK has a cat with the government title Chief Mouser to the cabinet office. That is so awesome.\n",
      "I'm sure that is one pampered feline. The PM of Australia's position doesn't actually exist in their constitution. Not much job security there... \n",
      "Note that seems really screwy. Have you heard of the actress Helena Bonham Carter? She was in the Harry Potter movies\n",
      "Yes, she's the great-granddaughter of the PM of the UK during WW I. \n",
      "Yep isn't that wild. I just think the Prime Minister idea is so different from that of a president being an American I don't know how I feel about it. I do like the idea of our president more though haha\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How's it going, are you into fashion at all? Nancy Pelosi's stilettos has been getting coverage on MSNBC\n",
      "Yes I am. I think that's an odd thing to cover. But it would be tough to give an 8 hour speech in those things.\n",
      "It's funny how high heels are being used in political rhetoric, like Ann Richards commenting on Ginger Rogers being able to do what Fred Astaire can except in high heels\n",
      "Yes I was kind of interesting. It seems like it's more a power move than anything else.\n",
      "Yea, I guess the Ferragamo Vara pump was a popular shoe for politicians\n",
      "Yeah it sounds like it. Some people call those high-heeled shoes postmenopausal Mary Jane's!\n",
      "Apparently the US is the only place obsessed with politician's shoes, even in Britain they cared what Theresa May wears on her feet\n",
      "That is kind of interesting. First lady Melania Trump was marked as disaster Barbie for wearing 4 inch high heels when she boarded Air Force One.\n",
      "Yea even people took issue when Michelle Obama wore Lanvin cap-toe sneakers to a food bank, it would be nice if people just mind their business\n",
      "Yes I agree. Did you know there are at least 17 ways to tie your shoes?\n",
      "No, I had no clue. You can also put dry tea bags in your shoes to absorb oder\n",
      "Oh that's good to know.Bill Nye the science guy holds a patent for ballet pointe shoes.\n",
      "He must make a lot of money since professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in one week\n",
      "Yes exactly. There are Wizard of Oz inspired shoes that actually guide you home when you click your heels together using a GPS system.\n",
      "That's pretty cool but I bet the shoes Stephon Marbury promotes don't have gps in them since they sell for $15\n",
      "Yeah exactly. I wish shoes cost that much nowadays. Queen Elizabeth II employs somebody to wear her shoes before her to ensure they're comfortable. Must be nice.\n",
      "Yea, the UK is quite odd, the Prime Minister's cat has the official title of Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office\n",
      "That is quite funny and odd. In 1995 a radio station successfully prank called Queen Elizabeth II by pretending to be the prim minister of Canada!\n",
      "That's pretty funny, I wonder if the UK's Prime Minister ever give out gifts like Japan's\n",
      "Yes I'm not sure. Andrew Bonar Law Is the only person from outside the UK to ever become the prime minister of UK. It was great talking with you today.\n",
      "well i have to go, nice chatting with you too\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "aliright. Do you have any interest in shoe styles? Their designs have varied throughout human history\n",
      "A little. I want to be more involved in style but have a wife and 2 little ones so have no money for style.\n",
      "Yea, I really only care about how comfortable they are but a lot of people are obsessed over them like when Nancy Pelosi wore 4 inch stilettos during a speech\n",
      "Maybe she's just really small and wanted to seem bigger and more powerfull than she really is. As a 6'6\" male, fashion does not come in my size so I don't even worry about it.\n",
      "Probably, people want to make statements with their fashion choice, especially women. I guess a Ferragamo Vara pump endears you to the working class, at least if your Ann Richards\n",
      "Aren't those expensive? Maybe not as expensive as 4 pairs of ballet shoes a week but still expensive...\n",
      "I have no idea, maybe from a man's point of view but I guess a lot of women see Ferragamo Vara pumps as lower end shoes\n",
      "I am sure they do not perform as well as 5000 year old shoes though.\n",
      "Would not surprise me at all if a 5000 year old basic sandal with a thin sole lasted longer than Ann Richards pumps or Condoleezza Rice's knee high boots\n",
      "\"Freeze frame matrix jump\" Ha! I wonder what the military thought of her dress....\n",
      "lol who knows. People were upset with Michelle Obama for wearing $540 pair of sneakers to a food bank\n",
      "No, they were upset they couldn't afford $540 sneakers. Haters! I get bugged when people do stuff like that. $540 is such a small part of her wealth that it's like $50 to normal people.\n",
      "Lol, yea, I really wouldn't even be able to tell what a Lanvin cap-toe suede sneakers looked like or if they were worth over $500, in fact I wouldn't even be looking at the shoes\n",
      "Me too! I found Steve Smith leaving his shoes on the field as a rememberance to homeless without shoes as a nice gesture.\n",
      "Yea, Steve Smith is a pretty stand up guy, too bad most people outside the teams he use to play for wouldn't know about him leaving out his cleats as a gesture for homelessness\n",
      "Im going to try and put tea bags in my gym shoes. See if it works to absorb odor...\n",
      "Lol, i didn't even know tea bags in a shoe could absorb odor, I wonder which type of tea works best\n",
      "I'll let you know if it is earl grey since that is what i have at home...\n",
      "sounds good, all I have is some cheap green tea bags at home, I'll see if those can get rid of shoe odor\n",
      "Nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi there. I love buying shoes! I feel that shoe quality is decreasing!\n",
      "really? i know very little about shoes. \n",
      "Yes apparently there was a 5000 year old pair of shoes that performed better than their modern counterparts.\n",
      "That makes sense. i bet that those shoes had to last a whole lifetime. no way to buy replacements. LOL\n",
      "Yes exactly! The NBA player Stephon Marbury promoted a line of shoes retailed at $15.\n",
      "Why so cheap? that seems a bit low. i guess he wanted to make them available for everyone?\n",
      "Yes I think you're right, which explains why he didn't accept any promo money to do it.\n",
      "Ok, that makes sense. I guess the shoes would last long enough to be worth the money.\n",
      "Yeah good point. There was also a football player, Steve Smith, who left his cleats on the field to raise awareness for homeless people.\n",
      "That is a great gesture. I wish more athletes would do things like that.\n",
      "Me too. Do you follow the news at all? The prime minister of UK, Theresa May has been trying to get a Brexit deal.10 Downing Street is her residence!\n",
      "May has a difficult task in front of her. I know that they have just a short while before the whole Brexit thing is supposed to go into effect. \n",
      "Yeah it sounds very clustered and confusing. What a mess. One odd fact about the Prime Minister in Australia is the fact that the position isn't even in the constitution!\n",
      "that is strange. i guess they just used the UK system because they knew how it worked. strange.\n",
      "Yes I suppose so. I would want to turn 100 in Japan because the Prime Minister sends you a silver cup to celebrate. Hopefully full of alcohol!\n",
      "Yes, fine japanese sake! a lot of people live to 100 there. japan might have to rethink giving out cups! \n",
      "Haha they are doing something right! Maybe the cheaper cups could just be red solo party cups!\n",
      "LOL I guess we could try to prank the Japanese prime minister into giving out cups like that.\n",
      "Haha it just might work. The actress who played Bellatrix in Harry Potter is a descendant of a UK prime minister!\n",
      "i dont really know the actors for harry potter. bellatrix? \n",
      "Her actual name is Helena Bonham Carter. Very good actress. Well very nice talking with you today. Bye!\n",
      "Oh, HBC. Yes, she is a great actress and very pretty. Have a great weekend!\n",
      "You as well stay safe bye!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi do you like star wars?\n",
      "I love Star Wars! I can't believe 20th Century Fox gave George Lucas all the rights!\n",
      "Thats pretty cool.. which one is your favorite?\n",
      "Revenge of the Sith is my favorite! How about you?\n",
      "\n",
      "I like return of the jedi!  \n",
      "Darth Maul is my favorite character out of all of them. Did you know Star Wars hold the Guinness World Records title for \"Most successful film merchandising franchise\"?\n",
      "That is completely believable lol They are opening a star wars land in disneyland in the next 2 years too.  \n",
      "Wow! The whole star wars saga is told by r2d2, about hundred years after return of the Jedi! Do you plan on visiting star wars land when it opens?\n",
      "Hell yeah!  absolutely,  I cant wait to see what new ride they will have.  did you know in SOLO al pacino turned down the role of han solo because he couldnt understand the script lol \n",
      "That would be so fun! i can only imagine being in a death star or riding a millennium falcon! \n",
      "did you know james earl ones spent only 2.5 hours recording darth vaders lines lol he made $7500.00\n",
      "No way! Sometimes things are best done the first time. Can't believe Bill Murray auditioned for the role of han solo haha.\n",
      "me either,  i dont think he is a good fit though,  \n",
      "I know I think Bill Murray is too much of a party animal. Han solo is a pilot! \n",
      "do you like Disney?\n",
      "I liked Disney a lot more when I was younger, I was a huge fan. Now, only a little.\n",
      "i see.  I just learned Frozen was the first animated disney movie directed by a woman. \n",
      "Pretty interesting. What else is interesting is that it would take over 9.4 millino ballons to lift carl's house in the movie UP!\n",
      "That is an insane amount of balloons.  i wonder if they have ever tried it. \n",
      "Someone probably will eventually. Jungle Book was one of my favorites. The vultures hair looks like those of the beatles!\n",
      "That was a good movie,   I really liked Aladdin,  Little Mermaid was good too. \n",
      "Yea those were my favorite too but I really like Hercules!\n",
      "I dont think I have ever seen that one actually.  Its been good talking though. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello,  do you like Star Wars?\n",
      "Hi! Yes I love Star Wars! How about you?\n",
      "Me too, Im a big fan of Star Wars movies, which one is your favorite one?\n",
      "I would have to say the very first Star Wars but they were all good I think. The Empire Strikes Back was really good too!\n",
      "I liked it a lot as well but I think that the Clone Wars was better, or maybe Episode I\n",
      "Good one too! It's crazy how 20th century fox thought Star Wars would be a flop! I can't imagine how much money these movies made in total!\n",
      "I imagine that a lot, considereing the amount of fans the franchise has, it even was the first movie to be dubbed in navajo\n",
      "Right! I thought that was awesome. I do know the first 8 films made over 8 billion....that's not including the merchandise! Star Wars holds a guiness world record for most successful merchandise franchise.\n",
      "I didnt know that, thas a lot of money what I did know is that the franchise had an estimated value of 65 billion dollars!! \n",
      "Wow! That is insane! Did you see Solo;A Star Wars Story? Al Pacino turned down the role of Han Solo because he didn't understand the script!\n",
      "I did see that one, and thats crazy, he missed on a really big role, that would have changed his carreer for sure.\n",
      "Exactly, too bad I guess lol, also they were thinking of casting Christopher Walken but don't know why he didn't get the part. \n",
      "He would have been a good Han Solo, there is a hole story behind Solo, like how he was a tie fighter pilot before.\n",
      "True! He would have been great in that role. I didn't know that, very interesting. I didn't know Solo; A Star Wars Story was distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures! I love Walt Disney!\n",
      "Yeah, Disney bought the franchise or the rights of Star Wars, and I also love Disney, one of my favorites, The Lion King\n",
      "Wow, I didn't know that. And yes I love The Lion King! it was the 1st Disney film to be dubbed into zulu for the african release, pretty cool! \n",
      "I guess that answers part of the question of why Disney is so popular, did you watch Frozen?\n",
      "Yes, it does! Yes, Frozen is great! And it was directed by a woman, first time for an animated film!\n",
      "It is! its also interesting how the toy industry gets involved with Disney and the fimals before they even begin, a lot of money there too huh!\n",
      "I know, I read that too, pretty crazy. I guess the toy industry is probably a huge part of all Disney productions!\n",
      "I guess it is, and Disney is considered as one of the \"Big Six\" fim studios, that is pretty interesting as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello are you a Star Wars fan?\n",
      "Absolutely YES. I love Star Wars, the American epic space opera franchise created by George Lucas.\n",
      "Me too!  I was only 7 years old when the first one came out so the timing was perfect for me.  James Earl Jones only spent 2.5 hours recording all of Darth Vader's lines for the first movie.\n",
      "And, made $7,500. for it. According to George Lucas, the entire Star Wars saga is told by R2D2, some hundred years after Return of the Jedi.\n",
      "Interesting.  I'm looking forward to the final installmant.  I really liked the spinoffs so far.  the Solo story was pretty good.  Originally Al Pacino turned down the role of Han Solo in the original film.  I never knew that.\n",
      "I know I loved all them so far. Starting off, we had the Star Wars Triology with the first one in 1977, Empire Strikes Back in 1980, and Return of the Jedi in 1983.\n",
      "Did you like the Rogue One spinoff?\n",
      "Yes, very much so. I liked the prequel trilogy as well that was released between 1999 and 2005 although it had mixed reactions to other critics and fans. I believe Rogue One was in 2016.\n",
      "Yes.  I liked the prequel trilogies.  I thought Phantom Menace was good even though a lot of people seem to not like it.  Some of the digitized characters I could have done without it.  But, the storyline was good.\n",
      "Yes, well the later movies have a LOT to live up to. Star Wars is the second highest grossing film series of all time. The film series has spawned into other media including books, TV shows, computer and video games, theme park attractions as well as comic books resulting in significant development of the series' fictional universe.\n",
      "It's incredible the business it has done.  As of 2018 the value of the Star Wars franchise was estimated to be a staggering $65 billion dollars!  WOW!!!!!!!\n",
      "Yes, and it's currently the fifth-highest-grossing media franchise. That is a big WOW. \n",
      "Crazy numbers indeed.  In 2013 Star Wars was dubbed in Navajo making it the first major film to be dubbed in a native American language.\n",
      "Awesome, did you know that Colin McGregor, Star War's actor, Ewan McGregor's brother is a British pilot and goes by the call-sign 'Obi Two'? How cool is that?\n",
      "Oh wow!  That is neat!  I never knew that.  Fascinating!\n",
      "Yes, and that James Cameron decided to quit his truck driving job to enter the film industry after watching Star Wars?\n",
      "Talk about a good career move that would pay off down the road!  Marcia Lucas was the reason for some major changes to the original movie and won an academy award for editing the film.\n",
      "Another fun fact that I learned is that there's a toy Hans Solo in every Firefly episode. I loved Firefly too!\n",
      "I never knew that.  I'm going to have to go watch and look for it.\n",
      "Yes, it was on the bridge console with the pilot. Did you know that Bill Murray auditioned for the role of Hans Solo?\n",
      "Wow.  I never knew that.  That might have actually worked with some of the funny comments that Solo makes.  I have to get running.  Nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Will the Star wars Movies be culturally relevant in 200 years? 1977 was a long time ago right now.\n",
      "I think it will, there are many fans of the saga, hopefully one day the old movies will be remade.\n",
      "Lucas had a plan for the stories.  I think the Disney takeover will cause some problems.\n",
      "I think it will, they bought the franchise for a lot of money its now worth like $65 billion\n",
      "$65 million is a lot.  Was Lucas lucky or talented.  I say lucky in some way.  \n",
      "It is a lot of money, Star Wars is great not only because of Lucas but his wife was a big influence on the franchise as well\n",
      "20th century fox thought it would be a dud.  Lucas was able to secure the rights to licensing any merchandise. Lucas becomes Billionaire.\n",
      "I heard about that, they have give the chance to forego his directors fee, it was about 500k, Lucas made the right decision\n",
      "I guess you should always bet on your self.  Solo, a star wars story was ok. But I think the film is at odds with some of the other narrative previously established.\n",
      "Valuable lesson, Fox sure had it coming, so do you have a favorite Star Wars movie?\n",
      "The empire strikes back I think.  Maybe the best is yet to come.  Given the movie Solo, how could Han have ever been a tie fighter pilot.  \n",
      "I thought the Solo movie was good but not as great at the other ones I liked The Clone Wars and The Phantom Mennace\n",
      "Rogue One was kind of refreshing.  Good sci-fi with not to crazy of a plot.  \n",
      "Thats was a good one I also liked it, you know Star Wars holds a Guinness World Record for the most successgull film merchandising film\n",
      "I am sure Disney will try hard to break that record.  The toy industry gets involved before the beginning of filming now.\n",
      "Im sure they are getting really involved in Star Wars, they also own the franchise \n",
      "I dont understand wreck it ralph.  how could anything be in development that long?\n",
      "Maybe Disney didn't had much faith on the franchise I do like the movies and I hear the video game is great.\n",
      "There is a wreck it ralph game?that would be merchandise before the movie. \n",
      "Yeah its originally a game I think, a really old arcade game, did you watch the movie frozen?\n",
      "Parts of Frozen.  Olaff the snow man is funny.\n",
      "Yeah Olaf is a funny one, cool fact about the movie but its the first animated Disney film directed by a woman, anyway its been great chatting with you I think Im going to watch a Disney movie now.\n",
      "yep, time for some movies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you watch the Academy Awards?\n",
      "I do! They are also known as the Oscars to many.\n",
      "I'm quite surprised how many oscars Eminem has won\n",
      "He has more than Johnny Depp and Will Smith!\n",
      "Thats so crazy to me. They are such good actors.\n",
      "They are, but the academy awards have been known to make questionable decisions. The Oscars, itself, has been nominated for emmys.\n",
      "Lol I would agree that they make questionable decisions for just about every award show.  It is interesting that walt disney still holds the record for most awards under his name.\n",
      "Blazing Saddles was nominated for 3 Oscars. Great comedy film.\n",
      "I have never seen that movie before. I take it its worth the watch\n",
      "It is an amazing film and ahead of its time.\n",
      "Ok I will have to watch it, wonder if its on netflix\n",
      "I am not sure, but you will easily be able to find it online.\n",
      "I had no idea how much money actors can make just for doing fan signings.\n",
      "They probably make so much money from that.\n",
      "I bet, can just keep surviving off that\n",
      "I wonder how much an Oscar victory shapes public opinion about you\n",
      "Honestly I don't think much. People really don't  care\n",
      "That's probably true. Their individual movie performance seems to be a bigger indicator.\n",
      "Yep. I think a lot of people don't value awards anymore because they truy don't include all actors who deserve to be nominated. \n",
      "It's so intriguing that Eminem has so many Oscar and emmy nominations.\n",
      "I agree, I wouldn't think with some of the things he raps about, he would be someone who would be nominated and win so many times. \n",
      "It has been wonderful talking to you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It's crazy to think that Daniel Day-Lewis has won Best Actor three times.\n",
      "I agree, I wonder which movies he won them for.\n",
      "Hmmm, I think he won for Lincoln for sure, and There Will Be Blood. The latter movie was really good. I'm not sure about the third one though.\n",
      "Blazing saddles was nominated 3 times, I honestly have no idea what that movie is about. I guess I probably should check it out. \n",
      "It is absolutely hilarious. It's got Gene Wilder (the dude who played Willy Wonka). Pretty much a 70s spoof on Western Movies.\n",
      "Oh its a comedy, then I definitely want to see it. I love comedy and spoof movies. I also like science fiction. I can't believe some of the actors make so much money just from doing autograph signings\n",
      "Yeah, and on top of that, we think Science Fiction is super common today, but I guess that it's only been mainstream for like 50 years thanks to Stanley Kubrick.\n",
      "I agree, I think a lot of people were like closet science fiction fans, but now with all the different events and what not they are more comfortable expressing that. I mean some may take it to far with the whole membership for life that covers you in case you come back\n",
      "Haha at least they have all their basis covered. Do you know any popular science fiction films that won Oscars? I know John Williams won a bunch for composing the Star Wars Music, but I wonder if any of them won for best picture?\n",
      "I honestly can say I do not remember a science fiction film winning an Oscar for best picture. It usually ends up be some dramatic movie or something. Its possible they may have won before my time, but I don't remember\n",
      "Yeah, what's you're favorite sci-fi film?\n",
      "Off the top of my head I can't think of one. I love movies dealing with aliens and such though. I also enjoy when the sci fi has a little bit of a fear element to it. What is your favorite\n",
      "I like the fear element too. Normally, I'm not too much into the alien/outer space movies, but I've been huge into the Marvel movies lately. I can't get enough of them.\n",
      "I do enjoy them as well, I like a lot of the series they have created too. Sometimes though the storylines are a little too much. \n",
      "Oh yeah, a lot of them are super unbelievable, even for the Marvel Universe. Did you see the most recent Avengers Infinity War?\n",
      "I haven't yet but I really want to. It looks really awesome. Did you see it and if so was it good\n",
      "Yeah, I really liked it. It's not your typical superhero movie or the typical \"hero's path\" plot. It goes up and down the whole time, so it's really entertaining. I think they have it on Netflix now.\n",
      "Oh awesome, I have netflix. I definitely will check it out. Thank you for the info. \n",
      "Not a problem, any recent movies you'd recommend me?\n",
      "Honestly as of lately the only movies I really saw were Hallmark Christmas movies, yes I am that dork that watches those lol \n",
      "Haha I love the cheesy Christmas movies!\n",
      "Awesome, they are the best lol\n",
      "I didn't get to watch many this year, but def will be in the holiday spirit in 2019.\n",
      "Me too, well it has been great chatting tonight. Thanks for the movie recommendation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hey there are you going to watch the academy awards this year?\n",
      "I would love to watch it, I don't know when it is though. I think the last Academy Awards was in early March 2018, so I anticipate it would be coming up in a couple/few weeks then?\n",
      "I think it is late Feb actually, and yes they give out like 24 awards\n",
      "That's so cool. I think I heard Walt Disney has received the most Oscar nominations out of anyone, ever. He once got a special Oscar (for Snow White) that was a statue of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\n",
      "Yes I think you're right, I also like Blazing Saddles it was nominated for 3 oscars\n",
      "I've actually never seen Blazing Saddles, is it any good? Who's in it?\n",
      "Yeah it's good and it's funny, not politically correct thought.\n",
      "Oh actually, I was thinking of Brokeback Mountain (way different). I have seen Blazing Saddles, I don't remember it too well but I remember liking it! Do you like sci fi movies?\n",
      "I do like those movies, I like stuff like robots, cyborgs and space travel, you?\n",
      "I love sci fi movies. I love the movie Contact, which came out in 1997. Did you know that Men in Black, Gattaca, The Fifth Element, and Starship Troopers all also came out in 1997>\n",
      "wow that was a great year for movies, I think the landmark scifi movie was 2001 by Kubrick back in 1968\n",
      "Oh yeah, 2001: A Space Odyssey. That was when the sci fi industry started to be taken seriously. And then once Star Wars came out, special effects really became popular and everyone went crazy over them\n",
      "ya you're right, cool that Nasa named Gattaca as the most accurate sci fi film\n",
      "Oh I didn't know that! I did know that apparently the movie \"Woman in the Moon\" influenced NASA a little in that they use a similar \"countdown\" and a launch pad, g-force, and multistage orbital rockets. It's so cool how sci fi films can be accurate\n",
      "I agree! nasa also has a list of space accurate terms for movies to use, nasa is cool!\n",
      "Yeah Nasa is definitely really cool, I'd love to learn more about it. By the way, do you like tennis? I used to play, but I was really bad haha\n",
      "ya I do I also used to play, I played in high school, you?\n",
      "I like watching tennis now. I don't know much about tennis, but I know a little about how grunting can give a tennis player more power in their swing and actually some professionals consider it \"cheating\"!\n",
      "lol I didn't know that, crazy the longest tennis game was 11 hours thats exhausting\n",
      "That's crazy! The longest single point lasted almost 30 minutes. They just kept hitting the ball back and forth, back and forth, 643 times! Talk about exhausting...\n",
      "wow thats nuts! and ya the longest game at 11 hours was actually played over 3 days, so even that is at least you're getting a break\n",
      "Wow three days, one match. I don't think I have the stamina for that!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I think my new goal is to own a house like the one Mel Gibson is selling. :-)\n",
      "Must be nice to own something for $16 million.  Ocean view is a plus!\n",
      "I think the privacy piece is crucial too. And the two different swimming pools seem ideal.\n",
      "Wow, sounding even better.  Gibson now is 62 and had started his career in Australia and received his recognition for \"Mad Max\" in 1979\"\n",
      "In that case, I've still got about 2 decades to catch up to where he's at. Maybe I can create the next fashion trend like the tennis guy who invented polo shirts.\n",
      "If you are interested in acting, then perhaps you can get a start in a role like a detective.  Gibson gained greater recognition in the U.S. for his role as a detective in \"Lethal Weapon\"\n",
      "There we go. I can go down the acting route. Then I can do the whole fan convention thing on the side as well.\n",
      "Cool!  Gibson did have a rebuild to his property after a fire in 1996\n",
      "I guess that's the downside to having a multi-million-dollar estate. You're always worried about protecting it. Maybe that explains the super-fortified and booby-trapped estate near Atlanta?\n",
      "that is scary! The inside of his house sounds exciting though.  he has glass antique pocket doors that open out to the canyon and ocean views below.\n",
      "Meanwhile I've got standard windows that overlook... a busy road. And the neighbor's house. Pretty boring in comparison. No European-imported elements or hand-hewn wood flooring here. \n",
      "He seems green friendly too.  He has working solar panels to supplement the electrical supply to the house.\n",
      "That's pretty smart. I think a lot of uber-rich people try to be able to set something up \"off the grid\". I wonder if Duchovny was responsible for that like he did so many of the other improvements.\n",
      "Maybe.  Do you follow the Academy Awards?  They are a set of 24 awards for artistic and technical merit in film\n",
      "Not very much. I tend not to watch too many movies. But I did see some of the Jimmy Kimmel one last year. I wonder what films from 2018 will be big winners this March.\n",
      "Walt Disney won a special oscar in 1938 for Snow White.  They made a statue that had one regular sized statuette and seven miniature oscars\n",
      "If anyone deserves a special oscar, it's Walt Disney. Or maybe Georges Melies.I learned more about his \"A Trip to the Moon\" from the movie Hugo. So I guess I do watch some movies after all.\n",
      "It looks like John Williams has the most nominations for oscars than anyone but disney\n",
      "Surprised by Eminem's success in the Academy Awards, too. Well, now you've got me interested in watching them this year. Nice talking to you!\n",
      "If you are interested in science fiction, you can look into the MIT sci-fi club which has two memberships.  They have a lifetime one and one that is more expensive and covers you in case you die and come back!\n",
      "That is downright hilarious. What will those MIT kids think up next? Take care.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you hear about North Korea and the Olympics?\n",
      "The winter olympics last year?  Weren't the games in North Korea?\n",
      "Yes, they were in PyeongChang.    The North Koreans sent a cheer squad.\n",
      "I think it would be great if every country sent a cheer squad.  I remember seeing some crowd pictures from London  (2012?) and they all looked bored.  Do you think it was a good squad?\n",
      "I did not see it, although the cheer translated as merely \"Go team!\"\n",
      "Sounds pretty tame.  I would have hoped it would be more aggressive.  It's the olympics!  Top of the world!\n",
      "Are you a fan of Hockey in the Olympics?\n",
      "I like hockey.  It's a fast game and a very athletic sport.  I hear that players can lose several pounds in a game.\n",
      "It amazes me that a hockey player was once traded for a dollar\n",
      "He must have been worth less than that to the trading team.  Maybe they were paying him too much already.  Do you play hockey?\n",
      "I do not, but many Canadians do, since both hockey and lacrosse are their national sport.\n",
      "What sports do you play?  I don't play hockey or lacrosse, but I love soccer.  I would like a cheer section like they have for club soccer.\n",
      "I play basketball, and have played on a court with a hockey rink under it!\n",
      "Was it cold for your feet?\n",
      "Yes, the floor was definitely colder than normal!    They played a Kanye West song during the game.\n",
      "Which game?  Your basket ball games?\n",
      "Yes.     They played gold digger, which is odd to try and rev up the crowd with a song in a minor key.\n",
      "What does minor key mean?\n",
      "Music typically has upward or downward sounding notes.    They are often found in gospel and hip hop.\n",
      "And minor key would be downward sounding?  Yeah, that would be hard to play to.  And a hard cheer ... even for a sad place like North Korea.  Would you join a cheer squad if they were as upbeat as the north koreans?\n",
      "Not sure.     Perhaps snl could do a skit mocking the situation, like they did with Kanye West and Taylor Swift.\n",
      "Oh, did they mock kanye for the swift interruption?  I thought that was well before it happened.  Pretty funny to think back on, for sure.\n",
      "Yes.     He believes aids in man-made too.    Anyway,  I think I'm going to go read the onion now!    Have a great day!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, do you like to fish or like aquariums? \n",
      "I love aquariums.  did you know the black swallower fish can eat prey twice its own length and ten times its weight.\n",
      "Nope.  That's some appetite. Fish are interesting.  Anything that can have a drink through their skin can't be all bad. \n",
      "I know, I could watch them in aquariums all day.  A seahorse has a neck.  It is the only fish with a neck.\n",
      "Seahorses are cool.  I would go fishing if they had it on PlayStation.  Not much for huntin' and fishin'...\n",
      "lol, me either.  I saw that there was a breed of Jellyfish that is immortal.  I wish I was, lol.\n",
      "Something that can sting you is also immortal... Hmmm.  I'll stick to the land playing my PlayStation or Nintendo.  I may be able to do black hole research that way.\n",
      "I saw the 1760 Playstation 3's were used by the US department of defense to build a supercomputer becuase it was the most cost effective.\n",
      "I bet Cray wasn't happy.  Wow, they could host quite a gaming competition. They could play the GTA theme and rock out. \n",
      "That would be cool.  They are even using PS3's to research black holes.\n",
      "I wonder how that works.  Consoles have come a long way.  Nintendo started out in 1889 as selling playing cards.\n",
      "they did??? well, The last game made for ps2 is fifa 14, which is also the first game to span 3 console generations.\n",
      "I don't even know the rules for soccer.  It's all the same.  My 12 year old son used to routinely beat me at everything.\n",
      "lol, My son as well.  Did you Nintendo is over 100 years old.  It started as a playing card company in 1889.\n",
      "Yep. They also own the Seattle Mariners.  Is that basketball?\n",
      "no, that is baseball. In 2001, they released a handheld console for Pokemon specifically. \n",
      "So many gadgets for these things.  PlayStation has something called a XrossMediaBar.  I'm pretty sure you can't eat it.\n",
      "I haven't heard of that, but they became a video game company in the 70.\n",
      "I don't think I heard of them until the 80s or even maybe the early 90s. \n",
      "Same with me.  I must have been 11 or so.  Nintendo is valued at over $85 billion\n",
      "Yep, I went into the wrong line of work.  I am the tetrapod of gamers.  Bye, nice talking to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How are you? Do you play playstation? They have released 4 consoles so far, all of which i have owned\n",
      "No, I don't.  I didn't know there was 4.\n",
      "Yes, and the first one was launched in 1994 in Japan\n",
      "They created a revolution that shows no signs of slowing down.\n",
      "Yep, the Playstation 2 has sold over 155 million consoles making it the best-selling console to date.I remember when it was out everyone had one\n",
      "Was it the first of it's kind?\n",
      "In terms of selling consoles, yea but the Playstation 3 couldn't live up to it and only sold 80 million consoles\n",
      "Have you ever played Airheart: Tales of Broken Wings?\n",
      "No, what system is that on?\n",
      "Playstation 4, Nintendo Switch and Mac.\n",
      "Oh cool, I'll look into that. Did you know the U.S. department of defense used 1760 playstation 3's to build a supercomputer?\n",
      "I had no idea, that must have been interesting.\n",
      "Yes, apparently using playstation 3's were the cheapest option\n",
      "Do you like to discover that you've been playing the game wrong or does it make you feel stupid?\n",
      "Depends, if I'm having fun I don't care but if I'm stuck and frustrated then I feel stupid\n",
      "Understandable.  I didn't know there was an immortal jellyfish.\n",
      "Yea I read about the immortal Jellyfish, it's able to revert back to like an infant state and keep cycling through the life stages if the conditions are right\n",
      "I wonder how old the oldest one is.  \n",
      "That be cool to find out, I've read of sharks and whales that were like 300-400 years old\n",
      "I wonder if they're studying the jellyfish to see if they can discover how to keep humans alive longer.\n",
      "It's possible, they probably could test it out on the zebrafish which shares 84 percent of human genes associated with diseases\n",
      "Yea, that's amazing.  I'll bet they study this fish in relations to us and our diseases.  \n",
      "Yea it's cool beans. Well I gtg, nice talking with you!\n",
      "Nice talking with you as well.\n",
      "Peace bro\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you doing there?\n",
      "Pretty good. Do you like Fish? Did you know most fish are cold-blooded?\n",
      "I like to eat fish. I ain't never had one as a pet. Fish are not warm and friendly like puppies and kitties.\n",
      "Nope, especially the black swallower fish that can eat prey twice its length\n",
      "I would love to have that ability. How many pizzas can I fit down my gullet? Let's find out.\n",
      "Lol, the black swallower can also eat prety 10x it weight, that doesn't sound too appealing\n",
      "I figure I could plan ahead. Maybe a long weekend. That would give me time to digest.\n",
      "Lol, did you know the seahorse is the only fish with a neck?\n",
      "I would think that the seahorse is unique for that face it has too. Horse-like. Unique. Do you like to eat fish?\n",
      "Yea when I could afford too. I wouldn't want to eat a zebrafish though, they share 84 percent of human disease associated genes\n",
      "I think that the secret to cures might be found in the humble zebrafish and its stripey hide.\n",
      "Or the immortal breed of jellyfish\n",
      "The jellyfish must lead a boring life. Always floating about, wondering about the universe, watching reruns.\n",
      "Yea it does sound boring. Speaking of the Universe, Playstation 3's are being used to research black holes\n",
      "The PS3 is a good way to learn about the cosmos. I figure that a bunch of those together could unlock the secret of life.\n",
      "Yea, they make good supercomputers, the Department of Defense used 1760 of them for that\n",
      "That is insane. I wonder how they got the money for that. \"We need PS3s for....research. Black hole...research. Yeah.\"\n",
      "Too they didn't buy any nintendos. Back in 2001 Nintendo released a handheld console specifically for pokemon\n",
      "I think that the Pokemon craze pass me by and that's a good thing. Anyway, great chat!\n",
      "You too, I think I'm gonna play some F-zero X, the first 60fps racing game\n",
      "Yes, great call!\n",
      "Have a good one\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi, do you like fish?\n",
      "They are alright,lol. How about you? I have been playing a lot of Nintendo.  have been playing Airheart. \n",
      "Nice, yeah I like the fish with a neck, the seahorses\n",
      "Oh, okay. That's a little interesting. I have been all caught up in Airheart and the way I was playing it wrong. Fortunately, I have be introduced to step to correct my strategy.\n",
      "speaking of video games, did you know PS3's are being used to study the black holes?\n",
      "No, that is totally weird. I can not imagine how they are doing that but  believe in NASA and their abilities! WOW\n",
      "I know that is insane where technology is going these days\n",
      "I know that the department of defense used playstations 3's to build a supercomputer! I guess it was cheaper than starting from scratch. That is wild.\n",
      "Yeah that is much cheaper I bet. have you ever played grand theft auto?\n",
      "NO I have no played that one. I did hear that when placed on a cd player it would play the soundtrack, thats some special secret trick. lol\n",
      "Yeah that is so cool. how about nintendo, do you play that?\n",
      "I am a huge fan. I started playing the handheld console in 2001 because I like pokemon and that is when they came out with the handheld. It was specifically for Pokemon originally. \n",
      "Nice I liked it too. did you know it was founded in 1889 as a playing card company\n",
      "Yeah, I did not know it was that old. Did you\n",
      "Yeah I did not know but apparently it has been that long\n",
      "Cool, I found out Nintendo produced a knockoff lego when they were a toy company.\n",
      "Wow, and they own the seatle mariners\n",
      "Man, that is a wide range of companies and interest! I heard you could order food directly to your seat through an app too.\n",
      "Are you kidding me, that is insane. wow\n",
      "Yeah, the technology out there is really beyond what I can imagine. Nintendo is Japan's most third valued company. ober $85 million.\n",
      "That is a lot of money but yeah, it so everywhere now so that makes sense. Nice chat :)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you ever heard of Date Lab?  I guess it's a WaPo column that helps people get dates?\n",
      "That sounds cool. Sounds like they have had some matches.\n",
      "I would imagine. First dates can be so awkward.  It rarely becomes a \"Lady and the Tramp\" thing. \n",
      "Yes. Do you like music? Did you know Steven Spielberg played clarinet on the jaws soundtrack?\n",
      "Yes and no, I had no idea he played anything. I did like the music in the movie \"O' Brother Where Art Thou\". \n",
      "That went platinum didn't it? I like Drake but did not realize he graduated high school at 25\n",
      "Yes.  I'm so out of it.  To me, drake is still a duck.  I do date and I like it to end with a hug regardless.\n",
      "And a concert is a good date I think. You know when drake went to drake university he did it in the middle of the night. \n",
      "I'm just not into rap.  To me it's usually very bad and profane poetry set to a well-worn backbeat.  It is impressive the Drake was determine to finish HS. \n",
      "I like old rap the new rap is hard to understand.\n",
      "I think Kanye West is hard to understand.  He thinks AIDS is a man-made disease?  Wow. \n",
      "I think Kanye west has been different since he married Kim Kardashian. The song golddigger is a minor key\n",
      "Yeah but it seems she already has the gold.  I think that whole Kardashian thing is weird.\n",
      "Yes. She got famous from a sex tape. Some musicians are smart. Big Sean had a 3.7 gpa and turned down a scholarship to be signed to Kanyes label\n",
      "I wonder what the major was.  A 3.7 in physics isn't the same as a 3.7 in music appreciation.  I thinks it's good that Kanye West can make fun of himself on SNL. \n",
      "Yes, but he can be arrogant sometimes. I still don't understand his relationship with Donald Trump.\n",
      "That is bizarre... I think he'll do anything to get his face in the limelight.  Like the interrupting thing he did to Taylor Swift.  \n",
      "And that was not even about him. He felt Beyonce should have won. I think it was nice of him to give his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at his concert. That shows the good side of him.\n",
      "Yeah, that's cool.  I would say to Kayne what one would say to a child about the interrupting thing. What if everyone did that when they didn't get their way? \n",
      "Kanye west was upset after hearing Eminems verse on Drakes album so he took two days and cancelled his appointments to rewrite his\n",
      "Sounds like he has a lot of attention to detail.  You've been an excellent chat partner.  Thanks. \n",
      "You too\n",
      "Bye.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "How's it going, did you know Speiberg played the clarinet on Jaws soundtrack? He's really talented\n",
      "I didn't know that.  How interesting.  That was such an epic soundtrack!\n",
      "Yea,I hear O brother, where art though? soundtrack was really good, it was certified 8 times platninum\n",
      "That was a great song.  I'm going to have that song in my head now.  lol  Do you like Daft Punk?\n",
      "Yea Daft Punk is cool and they did a great job with the tron legacy soundtrack\n",
      "I agree!  I was going to mention that.  Phil Collins recorded the English, Italian, German, Spanish, and French version of the Tarzan soundtrack.  That's pretty incredible!\n",
      "It is pretty cool, so are the names on the Batman Begins Soundtrack that are form names of bat genus\n",
      "Wow.  I never thought of that but you're right!  Do you like Kanye West?\n",
      "I liked his first albums and gold digger was a good song, it's the only top 10 hit Kayne did in minor key\n",
      "I didn't know that.  I never seen his SNL skit where he mocked himself for interrupting award shows.  Have you seen it?\n",
      "No but I did see a video of Kayne giving his mic to a fan in a wheel chair before\n",
      "That was pretty cool of him to do that.  Sometimes he has some different views on things.  Like for example he believes that aids is a man-made disease.\n",
      "Maybe Big Sean can explain that to him since he had a 3.7 gpa before signing with Kayne\n",
      "Nice GPA!  Are you familiar with Drake?\n",
      "Somewhat, I know he's a rapper and was in Degrassi\n",
      "Nice.  He graduated high school at the age of 25 in 2012.  He must have quit and went back?\n",
      "I guess so, most people graduate college before 25, not high school like Drake\n",
      "hahahaha  His debut studio album Thank Me Later was released in 2010 and debuted at number 1.  \n",
      "Nice. Kayne west took 2 days to rewrite his verse on forever after he heard Eminems\n",
      "Nice!  I remember his debut The College Dropout that came out in 2004.  It was a huge success and put him on the map.\n",
      "Well I have to go, nice talking with you\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I like when different races date and learn about each other. I think people should be open to this more often. This couple seems like they would work\n",
      "Yeah that was a insteresting story.  do you listen to music?  specifically kanye west or drake?\n",
      "Yes I like kayne west, He seems like he stands up for what he belives in. He also seems like a nice guy. I heard he even helps people and gives to his fans as much as he can. I think he does movie soundtracks\n",
      "Sure that sounds all good on paper lol but he has been acting crazy for while now.  He goes on all these uncalled for rants.  I am definitely not a fan of his and his music isnt even that good and he always claims to be the best rapper ever. \n",
      "Well I would go back and take a look at his work, He has has lots of hits. He has some of the most popular songs ever like his song gold digger. He also is very creative. I think he just feels that democrats have not done enough in 30 years and they are using blacks to get elected. \n",
      "That is just my opinion of him,  I do not like him and I personally do not find his music good reguardless of how many hits he has.  They do not sound good at all to me.  \n",
      "I am not a huge fan, I like techno and alternative rock more. I also like movie soundtracks like jaws and movies with dramatic cool sounds like batman. Kanye could do movie soundtracks and impress people.\n",
      "I recently learned that Michael Jackson helped with the sonic 3 soundtrack. \n",
      "That is amazing, I think music can make a movie or game much more memorable. They have cool soundtracks on spotify, I even hear you can create custom playlist\n",
      "Alicia keys was only 16 when she recorded the Men in Black sountrack. \n",
      "That amazing, I heard that daft punk got the rights to do the tron movie. They did it in exchange for pancakes. Yummy!\n",
      "\n",
      "That is interesting.  They must really like pancakes. \n",
      "It would be cool if drake did songs for movies. I heard he is a big fan of Winnie the pooh books. Most people do not know he collects them. He sound do a movie and make a gangster pooh\n",
      "I didnt know he appeared in Justin Biebers video \"Baby\" \n",
      "Yea drake is very soft and sensitive. When he did a song with Eminem he had to change his because he thought Eminems part was better.\n",
      "How does that show he is soft and sensitive?  He probably just wanted his part to sound as good as eminems \n",
      "A rapper being in justin bibers videos is soft in my book. Plus what grown mad collects whinne the pooh books. He also was on a teen show called Degrassi. \n",
      "lol k.  That video is pretty old,  maybe he was just getting noticed and making appearances,  doesnt really mean he is soft and sensitive.  Winne the Pooh books are classics,  they will probably be worth a lot in the futur.. \n",
      "His dance moves are very girly also. If you see him dance in his video Hot line bling you will know. He got a Grammy for that song.\n",
      "I have seen that video.   I dont think that his dancing is girly,  just a different style.  But I do not like that song,  it doesnt sound good to me. \n",
      "Do you like his song Gods plan, I heard it broke streaming records. That song is pretty good.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you enjoy music?\n",
      "I do, but I don't get to spend as much time listening as I might like. You?\n",
      "Lately I have been trying to move away from soundtrack and instrumental to more lyrical artists. \n",
      "I think the last soundtrack I bought was Guardian's of the Galaxy for my kid\n",
      "Did you know each soundtrack of batman begins is named after a genus of bats?\n",
      "That's really cool! I had the original Batman soundtrack years ago, but none of the more recent ones. I guess Steven Spielberg played the clarinet himself on the Jaws soundtrack.\n",
      "I sure do enjoy it when directors play a direct part in their creations\n",
      "lol yeah. Everybody says the O Brother Where Art Thou soundtrack is great, but I haven't heard it. I think George Clooney is on it.\n",
      "So is their any musicians you follow?\n",
      "No but my son is a huge fan of rap. I think he bought a Drake album recently. Drakes song Hotline Bling is sampled from the 1972 song Why We Can't Live Together. Everything old is new again!\n",
      "Ah Drake is a recognized choice. Surprisingly he gain initial fame for being a actor on Degrassi rather than as a musician.\n",
      "Wow I didn't know that! Weird that he was on a show about a high school, since he didn't graduate until he was 25 years old!\n",
      "I guess he was a perfect fit since he was in high school during the show?\n",
      "I guess so. His 4th album, Views, broke a lot of records, like it was in the top 100 for 13 nonconsecutive weeks. I guess he wasn't hurt by finishing school so late!\n",
      "Well now that he is so successful he is spending it on some odd things, like first edition children's books\n",
      "Oh yes, I heard he bought copies of Charlotte's Web and Winnie the Pooh in the UK. \n",
      "In any case, how about kanye west?\n",
      "He seems like kind of a weird guy to me. He says AIDS is a man-made conspiracy disease. \n",
      "I hope he doesn't think vaccines cause autism\n",
      "Oh god I hope not! There are people who will listen because he's a celebrity. *shakes head and rolls eyes* I hear his music is good though. I have to admit I haven't checked it out.\n",
      "I usually listen to what musicians say for music and what doctors say for medicine. I don't trust most musicians to tell me how to treat my body. In any case, I had a wonderful time chatting with you and I personally think his music is great, though some of his though aren't as much\n",
      "Cool. Nice to talk to you!\n",
      "Have a nice day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi do you like astronomy?\n",
      "its very interesting, but this is the first time I have read about the ganymede being so large\n",
      "That would be Jupiter's moon? I wonder if Jupiter is one of the five planets visible to the naked eye.\n",
      "I would guess from it size it is\n",
      "The planet Venus is the only planet that rotates clockwise and has no seasons. That seems boring.\n",
      "uranus also has a strange rotation, it rolls around rather than spinning\n",
      "That is unique. I think Mars sounds like a weird planet. It is called Red Planet and named for the Roman god of war.\n",
      "yes it says because of the iron oxide\n",
      "Mars is also considered a terrestrial planet and the fourth planet from the Sun. Must be hot there.\n",
      "but it has polar icecaps like us\n",
      "True and valleys and deserts so maybe it is pretty diverse. It is the second smallest planet in the Solar System.\n",
      "i did not know wifi was a byproduct from astronomy\n",
      "That is pretty neat. I didn't either. The town of Saadat Shahr in Iran is called the astronomy town and even bought an observatory. On special occasions they turn off all lights to improve the view of the night sky.\n",
      "I wonder what would people would say if we did that to an american town\n",
      "People would probably like it. Did you know Mercury was the smallest planet?\n",
      "yes I did, \n",
      "Would you be interested in the mars colonization project planned for 2023? I guess it will be a reality tv show.\n",
      "it would be cool, I did not know plants like Lichen could live there already.\n",
      "Yeah I think it sounds cool as well. It would take 2 or 3 days to get there under constant 1g acceleration. That's a bit long!\n",
      "it seems long\n",
      "Well it's been nice chatting. Maybe I'll see you on that trip to Mars. LOL!\n",
      "one day bye\n",
      "Have a nice day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good evening! Are you into astronomy? Did you know that Venus has no seasons because it doesn't tilt?\n",
      "I enjoy learning about it.  That is interesting about Venus.  Our solar system is pretty vast\n",
      "It is! Did you know that there is a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph in 2000 degree Fahrenheit weather? It sounds fascinating.\n",
      "Wow!  It also sounds dangerous!  How about the fact that all of the planets would fit between the earth and our moon?\n",
      "Yes! Fascinating. And precursors to life have been discovered in a planetary system about 455 light years away.\n",
      "I wonder how they determined that?  That seems like a microscopic issue rather than a telescopic one.\n",
      "Yes, I would like to know. I've been reading about observational versus theoretical astronomy, but I don't know what research methods would have been used to detect the building blocks of life so far away.\n",
      "Can you imagine how complex the orbit would be for that planet that orbits four stars?\n",
      "I haven't heard of that planet! What is it called?\n",
      "That was all I read about it.  However, the math that describes orbiting one star is complex enough.  That math would be crazy.\n",
      "Yes! Did you know that planets were redefined in 2006 by the Astronomical Union? It's been controversial. The definition is based on where an object orbits and disregards its mass.\n",
      "I suppose that is why Pluto was downgraded.  I wonder how the Chinese are controlling their rover on the dark side of the moon right now.\n",
      "Yes, I wonder. Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta were also once considered planets and then downgraded.\n",
      "Mankind has studied astronomy for a long time.  Even the Vatican has an observatory for studying it.\n",
      "Yes! And the ancient Babylonians too!\n",
      "Harlow Shapley, a noted astronomer decided to study it because it was the first subject in the course catalog at college.  Strange world we live in.\n",
      "Yes, and a byproduct of astronomical research led to the development of wifi. Had you heard that?\n",
      "No.  But I am old enough to remember Teflon being a byproduct of space exploration by the USA.\n",
      "Fascinating! I was not aware of that. Did you know that sounds are higher pitched on Mars because of atmospheric differences?\n",
      "No. But it makes sense.  Sound is different in water here on earth.  I also read of a town in Iran that is so much into astronomy that they shut the lights down on occasion to improve the view of the night sky.  \n",
      "Wow! That would be a fun place to visit. Well, it's been good talking to you! Have a wonderful evening!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Deadpool 2 is a great movie!!!\n",
      "I agree. Ryan reynolds is so fun in it\n",
      "He, is I think he nailed the role and well the movie has a pretty good cast as well\n",
      "yeah. did you know deadpool described himself as ryan reynolds with a shar-pei, before ryan was even cast?\n",
      "Really? that is an interesting fact, another cool fact is that the video game cost more to make than the movie\n",
      "wow. apparently the voice of the mystery villain is ryan as well\n",
      "You know Deadpool is the highest grossing r rated film to have a different director than Cameron or Lucas!!\n",
      "I did not know that, quite something. speaking of superheroes, do you like Marvel Comics?\n",
      "I do, some of my favorite heroes are from the Marvel Comics universe, I sure love the movies\n",
      "did you know they offered the right to sony for all superheroes and they only bought sony?\n",
      "I heard they bough Spiderman and I used to like the old Spiderman movies with Toby Maguire as the star, he was a good Spiderman\n",
      "yeah I will agree with that, for sure. they should have bought the rest when they had a chance\n",
      "I agree, considering now they are worth billions, that sure was a poor investment decision, the X-Men are also pretty good, I like them\n",
      "did you know marvel successfully argues in court that mutants in x-men are not humans?\n",
      "I didnt and did winning that argument helped them in any way?\n",
      "yeah it did actually, they paid the lower rate on toys\n",
      "Oh I see Im guessing that made them millions then, Wonder Woman is also a great film, have you watched that one\n",
      "Yeah I have I really loved it and looking forward to the second one. You?\n",
      "I did, I thought it was a decent film and will watch the second one for sure, it generated a lot of money\n",
      "yeah it is the highest grossing superhero origin movie\n",
      "and also highest grossing WWI movie, I guess Wonder Woman has a lot of fans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi. Do you like superheroes? I really like Wonder Woman and the film they made based off of her in 2017.\n",
      "Some of them.  I haven't seen Wonder Woman yet. I guess I should, it is the top grossing movie for WW I movie.\n",
      "It was really good and the lead actress Gal Gadot did a fantastic job. It could be because she served two years as a soldier in the Israel Defense Forces.\n",
      "That would be good prep.  She didn't even realize she was auditioning for that part!  I love to hear stuff like that!\n",
      "I like how far Wonder Woman's character has come. When she first appeared in 1941 the group made her their secretary.\n",
      "It was good for women too.  2017 was the 1st year since 1958 that the top 3 highest grossing movies were female led.\n",
      "That is so cool. Comic book movies are really successful but I guess it wasn't always that way. In 1998 Marvel offered Sony almost all of its characters for 25 million but they rejected because they only wanted Spiderman for 10 million.\n",
      "It seems like they have really taken off lately.  Marvel created a character named Blue Ear for a 4-year-old boy that had hearing problems.  That was cool. \n",
      "That is so kind. And it started because he did not want to wear his hearing aids and told his mother \"Super heroes don't wear hearing aids\" so marvel created one.\n",
      "Very cool.  Did you know there is one character owned by both Marvel and DC that is designed to keep the companies' universes separate?\n",
      "Leave it up to big business to find a way to keep their investment safe. It is interesting that Disney does not own the rights to big marvel characters East of the Mississippi due to contract with Universal Studios.\n",
      "I guess one would need to be a lawyer to understand the Mississippi thing. Did you like either of the Dead Pool movies.  Funny dark humor...\n",
      "I only saw the first one not the second but I think I should. It is the highest grossing R rated film not directed by James Cameron or George Lucas.\n",
      "I guess it cost more to make the video game than the 1st movie. SW development is expensive!\n",
      "What is nice is even though it is competition for directors like James Cameron, he read the script and championed the film to Fox executives.\n",
      "Good for him.  It is true that people get used to one particular actor doing superheroes.  I can't imagine anyone but Reynolds doing Deadpool...\n",
      "What is odd is that the comic book series in 2004 had Deadpool describe himself as \"Ryan Reynolds crossed with a shar pei\" so Ryan Reynolds believed he was destined for the role.\n",
      "It seems that is true.  He has that personality.  Downey is another one for Iron Man.\n",
      "I think the same thing about Hugh Jackman as Wolverine but the director knew him as musical theater Australian unknown actor.\n",
      "Interesting.  I guess the case could be made for Gal Gadot for Wonder Woman.\n",
      "Some people are just born to play the role. Well thank you for chatting. I learned a lot of new and fun information today.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello have you seen deadpool 2??\n",
      "I haven't seen it yet, did you? I am a pretty big fan of the Marvel Comics Universe though.\n",
      "Yeah I have seen it ,  it was really good and funny.  \n",
      "How was Ryan Reynolds? He's carved out a pretty iconic role for himself as Deadpool and was great in the first one.\n",
      "Oh yeah,  for sure,  he was perfect for this role.  Did you know in the 2004 comic Deadpool describes himself as a \" Ryan reynolds with a shar-pei\"  which lead Ryan to believe he was destined for the role lol \n",
      "No, that's awesome though. Did you know James Cameron and David Fincher were involved in pushing for Deadpool 2 to be made. Two pretty big names right there.\n",
      "wow that is awesome.  Thats pretty funny that the Deadpool videogame cost more to make than the movie.  lol I never played the game.\n",
      "Are you a fan of any the other Marvel characters/movies? Stan Lee's estate must have been very valuable.\n",
      "Yeah I love all of them,  I guess if id have to pick,  I really like Thor,  Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers.  How about u?\n",
      "I'm a big fan of Thor. I thought Ragnorak was the best Marvel movie. Chris Hemsworth is awesome as Thor. They probably couldn't have picked anyone better.\n",
      "Right!  Thor ragnarok was hilarious!  That was the best of the thors. \n",
      "It's funny back in 1998 Sony could have bought all cinematic rights for Marvel for $25 million but they decided rejected the offer. I bet they wish they didn't.\n",
      "I know right,  this couldve been big awhile ago,  but I guess they only wanted spiderman. \n",
      "Yeah, crazy. Oops. Did you know there's a character owned by both Marvel and DC?\n",
      "No,  who is it?\n",
      "It's this character called Access. It's kind of weird, his sole purpose is to keep the Marvel and DC separate universe separate from each other.\n",
      "Thats cool,  I wonder if they will make a movie about him,  since both DC and Marvel have a ton of movies and tv shows out now. \n",
      "I don't think so. Do you like any of the DC movies? I heard Wonder Woman was good but didn't see it.\n",
      "Yeah wonder woman was great,  I think the second one is coming out soon,  The newer supermans with Henry cavill are good,  I like the batman series too,  and the tv show the flash.  Arrow was good but hes so dark,  I only have room for one dark super hero and I like batman lol \n",
      "Cool, how did you like Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman?\n",
      "She is awesome,  really great actress,  I liked her in fast n furious series.  She also served in the Isreali army. well I believe everyone in Isreal has to serve its a law\n",
      "I didn't even know she was in the Fast N Furious series. I remember the classic Lynda Carter Wonder Woman too. Do you?\n",
      "No I don't think I ever watched the older wonder woman.  Yeah she plays Giselle in Fast N Furious. \n",
      "I remember my parents used to have it on every once in a while, it was pretty good. I should check out the new movie. Can't believe Marvel started in 1939.\n",
      "I know right,  its been awhile! Its been fun chatting. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "Hello, doing great! You? Are you interested in astronomy?\n",
      "Sure. I don't know much about it. What about you?\n",
      "I'm impartial but I am surprised by a couple of facts in my reading, like when September ends, the planet is even brighter than in previous months.\n",
      "People have been watching the skies forever. Ancient Babylonians had a  were  able to track planets such as Jupiter with mathematical precision. Nowadays we're pretty disconnected from the solar system.\n",
      "Yes and without special equipment, only five planets in the solar system are visible to the naked eye.\n",
      "The tech for viewing planets has had benefits in other areas. A critical step in creation of wi-fi was a byproduct of research into improving astronomy\n",
      "That information gained can also be compiled to produce sounds and songs that illustrate what space is like for visually impaired individuals, that's pretty neat!\n",
      "Would you want to live on Mars? A Mars colonization project is planned for 2023.\n",
      "I'm not sure, but if I did, I don't think I want to be one of the first ones on there. Do you? And do you think colonization on Mars by 2023 is feasible?\n",
      "No, not really. Flying to mars under constant 1g accelaration  takes only 2 or 3 days. But do we have tech like this?\n",
      "I'm not sure and even if there is tech that is capable of that, do humans survive that at those speeds? It'll be pretty neat to see the sunset on Mars though, because it is blue.\n",
      "I guess that's because the atmosphere is different. I don't know what kind of life it can support, but there is an atmosphere.\n",
      "Yes, I think I'd like to visit the Saadat Shahr 'astronomy town' because the residents have a strong passion for stargazing, so that's what the small stargazing community is called.\n",
      "I wonder if they'll find a planet that can support life.Astronomers have already detected building blocks of life in a planetary system 455 light-years from us.\n",
      "I think we will or maybe the movie with Matt Damon really convinced me, I forgot what it was called.\n",
      "I don't remember either. I think that it's expensive and high risk. Probably better to invest in better ways to live on this planet, the one we're designed for.\n",
      "I agree but I must say that human perception of the planets have changed as scientific knowledge advanced. I wonder how older generations of people feel about the solar system knowing what we know today.\n",
      "They feel the way that the younger generations will in 40 years. Astonished about how much has been learned and our tiny place in the universe. I enjoyed chatting with you!\n",
      "Yes, same here! Have a great day!\n",
      "Thanks!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hey there, do you like superhero movies?\n",
      "Yes, I like superhero movies. Do you?\n",
      "Yes, I do. Do you have a favorite publishing company that is in charge of superhero movies and such?\n",
      "Yes, I do. My favorite publishing company associated with superhero movies is Marvel. What's your favorite publishing company?\n",
      "Same here. Do you have a favorite superhero?\n",
      "Yes I do. My favorite superhero is Batman.Who is your favorite superhero?\n",
      "I am going to go with the classic I think, SUperman. Apparently Spider-man is the only big superhero owned by Sony\n",
      "I like Superman. Yes, Spiderman is the only big superhero owned by Sony, in partnership with Marvel Studios. \n",
      "Have you ever heard of the character Access\n",
      "No, I haven't heard of Access. What kind of superhero is that?\n",
      "It is character whose main power is to keep marvel and dc separate from each other and is co-owned by both studios\n",
      "Interesting! I like the concept of that character. Which studio do you prefer: Marvel or DC?\n",
      "I am not sure, I do not pay much attention to studies as I do to the movies they make. Marvel did create a special superhero for a little boy though\n",
      "Which superhero did they create for the little boy?\n",
      "It is called Blue Ear because the little boy was hard of hearing\n",
      "That is heart-warming. Did you know that Marvel claimed in court that since mutants aren't people, they should pay the lower rate on X-men toys. Because they're not considered human, so they don't qualify as dolls.\n",
      "THey must have had some really good lawyers. Did you every watch wonder woman?\n",
      "Yes, I have watched Wonder Woman. Did you know Gal Gadot fought in the Israeli special forces?\n",
      "I think that is why they hired her, she had the skills she thought she was testing for catwoman not wonder woman\n",
      "I am surprised to hear that. I thought auditions were more straightforward. I imagine it was a surprise for her to find out the truth!\n",
      "Yeah, well she did well. GOod for her. I mean wonder woman is the highest grossing superhero origin movie\n",
      "Yes, it is. That makes me happy. I am glad Wonder Woman did so well in theaters. Did you see the  movie?\n",
      "I did it was so good. And apparently it is also the highest grossing wwi movie too\n",
      "Yes, it is. That is good. Well, it was nice talking with you!\n",
      "Same here. Have a good one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello! How are you?\n",
      "I am good! Currently fascinated about Mars. What about you?\n",
      "I'm good as well! Mars is so crazy these days huh?\n",
      "Yes! Have you heard about the sounds on mars?\n",
      "Don't they have a higher pitch than sounds on earth?\n",
      "Yes, due to differences in atmosphere, sounds on mars have a higher pitch than they do on Earth. \n",
      "That is so cool! Can you believe how they are trying to fund a mars colonization project by 2023?\n",
      "That is crazy. Do you know how they are going to fund it?\n",
      "By creating a reality tv show. hmmm....\n",
      "I wonder what that reality tv show will be about. I love reality TV so I will probably watch it regardless. \n",
      "Oh see, I'm the complete opposite on that one haha. Do you know how long it would take to get to mars?\n",
      "If you fly to mars under constant 1g acceleration it will only take 2 or 3 days. I thought it took a lot longer. \n",
      "Me too! Movies make them seem longer, but they might be going much much slower for airtime lol.\n",
      "That is true. Have you heard about the lost satellite on mars?\n",
      "Didn't Lockheed Martin lose on somehow?\n",
      "Yes, locheed martin used the imperial system while nasa used the metric system. \n",
      "Oh boy how funny! Can you imagine if Earth had shard of glass that precipitated sideways at 4500 mph?\n",
      "That would be terrifying. Especially because they are in 2000 degree Fahrenheit weather. \n",
      "We would probably have some great tans on that planet haha.\n",
      "Very true. I wonder how scientists even measured that. \n",
      "Good question! Anyways, had a great chat with you, have an awesome day!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you hear that Elmo is the only non-human to testify before the us congress? \n",
      "I did hear that. I also heard that are three subways to transpport staff between the capital and their offices.\n",
      "Wow did you know that they have fantasy congress? \n",
      "They aslo have a baseball game that dates back to 1909.\n",
      "wow i never know that. Are you a star wars fan?\n",
      "I am a fan. Are you?\n",
      "Yes indeed George is a genius, don't you think?\n",
      "I do, both creatively and financially!\n",
      "The first one was in the 70's and it was the last three in the series that he released. \n",
      "The first 8 films were nominated for academy awards and a combined box office of $8.5B!\n",
      "Yeah and his name is still living on long after he's gone. That what legacy is all about!\n",
      "I read his ex-wife has done a lot for the movies too. She even killed obi wan!\n",
      "You got to feel me in on that one. i liked the video games as well. The new one aren't as good but still good enough, the movies i mean.\n",
      "It was her idea to kill off obi wan, leia's incestual good luck kiss and make the trench run more tension filled.\n",
      "wow now that's drama. James earl jones spent 2.5 hours only recording all of darth vadors lines for 7,500.\n",
      "If only he knew what that would do, he would have demanded more. Or if he was paid by the hour, at least talk slower.\n",
      "Right but i'n sure that was a lot of money back then. \n",
      "Not if all 8 of them made $8.5B in total box office! That's a small percent for a main character!\n",
      "7.500 for two hours of work will work for me my friend, lol. Astronauts in a space suit can not whistle. \n",
      "Yes, I would definitely take it. Why cant they whsitle?\n",
      "I have know idea just a known fact. Better question is why would they want to in that suit, lol. apparently there is a water cloud in space that hold 100 trillion times the amount of water on earth.\n",
      "There's a lot of questions there! Maybe for our next chat. Have a great day!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello. Do you like information about space?\n",
      "Absolutely! What do you know about space?\n",
      "I find it interesting that astronauts cannot whistle in a space suit.\n",
      "That is interesting. I wonder what prevents that from happening.\n",
      "Me too. They also touch helmets on space walks when they want to talk in private. That's pretty neat.\n",
      "So they just walk up to each other and bump helmets real quick?\n",
      "Yes, I believe so. Are you a star wars fan\n",
      "I have actually only seen the first film but I am a huge fan of Carrie Fisher. RIP.\n",
      "I may have seen one a very long time ago. Fox did not think it would succeed so they told George lucas if he directed it he would get all merchandising rights to himself. He must have made a fortune.\n",
      "Oh I actually knew that about the films! He definitely made a fortune. They thought that the entire franchise would never make any money - especially when it came to toys and such. I bet they regret every bit of that LOL\n",
      "Yes, and his wife Marcia was the reason they made all the good changes. She even won an award for it.\n",
      "Good changes in regards to what?\n",
      "Well the good luck kiss with leia, obi wan dying\n",
      "I have already forgotten about all of this. \n",
      "Some things are really interesting. I don't know why  I never watched more than the first one. Did you know in 2013 it was dubbed in Navajo. It was the first movie ever dubbed in the native american language\n",
      "Wow. Star Wars really is a historical movie in pop culture. I had no idea they did that. 2013 was not very long ago either.\n",
      "No and another cool thing is James Earl Jones only spent two and a half hours recording darth vaders lines. Doesn't he do cell phone commercials too.\n",
      "I am not sure what he does. James Earl Jones was also Mufasa in the Lion King I think? I think he will be in the remake too.\n",
      "Cool. Good chatting with you\n",
      "Same to you!\n",
      "Same here\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a Star Wars fan?\n",
      "Yes I personally love Star Wars. George Lucas is a visionary for creating it.\n",
      "For sure, Stars Wars made him a billionaire!\n",
      "No doubt. The first eight films were nominated for Academy Awards and also commercially successful.\n",
      "Wow, I think George Lucas' wife got an oscar for editing for the films\n",
      "Yeah it sounds like she was the major reason for making changes to the original film.\n",
      "I wonder if it was for the good or for the bad lol\n",
      "Yes I would like to know that as well! I think it's so cool that George Lucas was able to keep licensing and merchandising rights for them self. It really paid off!\n",
      "For sure, he would not be worth nearly as much as he is now. Did you ever hear how much James Earl Jones was paid for his voice \n",
      "I almost don't believe this number but he was only paid $7500, can you believe that?\n",
      "I believe that, that would be like 3000 dollars per hour I bet lol. I am hoping he made more after the first movie\n",
      "Yeah I am sure he did. In 2013 Star Wars was dubbed in Navajo making at the first major film to be dubbed in a Native American language.\n",
      "That is awesome that they did that, but was there really that much of a demand for that?\n",
      "Yeah I'm not sure it might just be more symbolic than anything. But I love how the film is set in space. It is such an interesting concept.\n",
      "For sure, it was out of this world at the time, no pun intended lol. Space is so mythical \n",
      "Ha ha it really is. I would really love to go to space. But apparently astronauts in space suit cannot whistle, I wonder why?\n",
      "I couldn't whistle and I wasn't even in space lol! I wonder why too, maybe the no gravity makes it impossible\n",
      "haha! Yes perhaps. If astronauts out on a spacewalk wanted to talk in private they would touch helmets. Good to know.\n",
      "Lol, that is awesome, secret code is the best! It was so nice chatting with you!\n",
      "Yes it is! Astronauts even got free corvettes back in the day! So nice talking with you too. Bye!\n",
      "I want a corvette, lol. Have a great weekend!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi how are you today?\n",
      "Hello - I am good. How are you?\n",
      "Great! enjoying this snow day here in New jersey! are you into politics at all?\n",
      "Oh wow that's awesome. It's just raining here. I'm in Ohio. I'm not huge into politics. What about you? \n",
      "Not really. I did not know that Hilary was president of young republicans in college. Makes sense though.\n",
      "Oh wow I didn't know that either. I do support Trump though. I think he's a little hot headed, but doing good things so far. \n",
      "I do not support him but I think he could be doing worse. I think Kanye should run for president in the next election.\n",
      "LOL - that would be funny to have Kanye run for president. He's a huge trump supporter. \n",
      "Did you know Kanye believes aids is a man made disease?\n",
      "HAHA yea I saw that one time. He says some really weird things at times. \n",
      "He also once gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair during a concert. I guess he has some good in him.\n",
      "That's good. I saw one time when he stole the mic from Taylor Swift. It was a pretty low move of his. \n",
      "Yea I think I remember that. Poor Taylor swift.\n",
      "Yea it was not a cool move to do. I saw that rapper Big Sean had a GPA of 3.7 and turned down a scholarship in Michigan. \n",
      "That is impressive. I have been to a Big sean concert twice!\n",
      "Oh wow that's cool. How was the concert?\n",
      "Great! He is very talented! Better than Kanye in my opinion. Kanye once did a snl skit mocking himself for interrupting award shows!\n",
      "I'm not a huge fan of Kanye music.\n",
      "Me neither, his only song gold digger was in the top ten songs of all time. \n",
      "I don't think I've heard that song before. \n",
      "That was the only song I really ever liked from him.\n",
      "It was good talking to you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you know that Hillary Clinton was president of young republicans in college?\n",
      "No, but I'm not surprised. \n",
      "Apparently she adopts a southern drawl when campaigning in southern states.\n",
      "That I did know. What I didn't know was that Taylor Swift is taller than Kanye. \n",
      "Kanye is an interesting character. He believes that aids is a man made disease.\n",
      "I know, I didn't know that Evel Knievel sued him though. \n",
      "Do you know what he was sued for?\n",
      "Damage to his reputation from \"Touch the sky\"\n",
      "Kanye can be nice sometimes. He once gave a mic to a fan in a wheelchair at a concert.\n",
      "I head about that, I didn't know he was 41 though.\n",
      "Well, he has accomplished a lot in those years, and has been responsible for cultural movements and progressions within hip hop.\n",
      "I didn't know that he incorporated gospel in some of his songs. \n",
      "That's cool. I also like how eclectic his music is.\n",
      "Yeah, I do too. It is pretty interesting. \n",
      "Do you like music in the minor key? One of  Kanye's most successful songs, Gold Digger, is in the minor key.\n",
      "I actually play a lot of music. I heard that Kayne barely plays in minor keys, sort of surprising to me. \n",
      "I kind of like how surpising Kanye can be. Have you heard of dragon energy?\n",
      "He's a lot more interesting, that's for sure. \n",
      "Yeah, I am not really sure what dragon energy is but Kanye has been tweeting about it.\n",
      "I'm not sure either, he should make a soft drink called that! LOL\n",
      "Well, that would be interesting but probably not surprising in the scope of what Kanye does, haha!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you? Who would you vote for, Hillary or Kanye?\n",
      "Kanye West for sure! No more gold diggers. What about you?\n",
      "I would want them on the same ticket. They could release duets and make a ton of cash.\n",
      "I would love all the Kanye conspiracy theories when he's in office. He believes that aids is a man-made disease.\n",
      "I figure that he could go into the secret files and find out about Area 51 and the AIDS conspiracy. The aliens brought AIDS.\n",
      "Haha. Do you remember him on TV during that Hurricane Katrina telethon years back?\n",
      "Um not really. Did he say some crazy stuff? Did he say the govt caused the hurricane?\n",
      "Oh yea. He said \"George Bush doesn't care about black people\" on live tv.\n",
      "Well, that would make sense from his point of view. The hurricane devastated the place and there was little help.\n",
      "True. In hindsight, it actually doesn't sound crazy at all. Do you remember when Kanye interrupted Taylor Swift?\n",
      "He busted on stage and grabbed the mic. That was crazy. Maybe he could be president one day?\n",
      "I think you have to be slightly crazy to be president. Like who actually wants to be president. \n",
      "I think Kanye would want to have Trump as his running mate. \n",
      "He could get rid of Mike Pence. Trump and Kanye 2020?\n",
      "Kanye and Trump, 2020. Kanye don't play that. He ain't VP.\n",
      "Oh man. I don't know if Trump would be down to be VP, especially after being the P. They might have a conflict.\n",
      "Maybe Tump would do it if it meant he'd have more free time, maybe to play golf.\n",
      "As much as Trump would like that it's bad for his brand. He wants to make his brand name more valuable.  Most of net worth is attributed to the value of his name. \n",
      "True. He could put a TRUMP sign on the guest house and rent it out. Anyway, great chat!\n",
      "I think he would like to put a Trump sign everywhere.  Kanye might like it too, since he wears that hat everywhere.  Take care!\n",
      "Have a fine night!\n",
      "Thanks you too\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you seen the black panther movie?\n",
      "No I haven't.  I'm not a very big super-hero movie person.  Have you?\n",
      "yeah, it was actually pretty good and apparently good enough for someone think that india could take lessons from it. LOL\n",
      "Yes, I tend to doubt the film makers were trying to remind Africa and India of their shared past. \n",
      "hahahaaa.. you never know! the inspirations has to come from somewhere!\n",
      "I suppose. I did think it was interesting Marvel Studios put up their characters as collateral.  If it hadn't been successful Merril Lynch might have been making these movies\n",
      "True!  The Black panther is the richest super hero.\n",
      "Is he?  Richer than Bruce Wayne?  Or is that a separate universe\n",
      "it just says superhero... says tony stark is worth 100 million and black panther is 500 million.  Maybe they are talking about marvel\n",
      "Maybe.  And Black Panther was the 18th Marvel universe film.  I guess most of them have escaped my notice\n",
      "Maybe! Would rather watch a disney movie or a marvel movie?\n",
      "Umm, Disney I suppose.  But really I kind of tend to think of them all as kids movies anymore.  Just a sign of getting old I guess\n",
      "oh that's so true!  you see frozen was the first disney film to be directed by women?\n",
      "I did kind of like Frozen.  Sad that it took that long to get a female director. \n",
      "well, i guess it's better late than never.  like early to the table is the toy industry taking advantage of putting toys out before a film is released\n",
      "Well we've got to hook the little kids, parents are where the money is no?\n",
      "yes they are!  Geez... wreck it ralph development started back in the 80s\n",
      "I don't remember if I ever saw the original jungle book, but its very funny that the four vultures were supposed to be voiced by The Beatles\n",
      "did not know that!  lion king was dubbed in zulu for africa\n",
      "Interesting.  I'd love to hear \"circle of life\" sung in zulu\n",
      "so would i... probably on youtube.. been a good chat, thanks!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What's up? Have you seen Black Panther yet? It was directed by Ryan Coogler who is pretty good\n",
      "I did see the movie. I'm a fan of Danai Gurira, she's great. I though the movie was pretty good.\n",
      "Yes, Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa was an excellent choice\n",
      "I know, he was good too. I thought it was funny how the women kind of took over the movie though. They really stole the show. I was impressed with the whole cast. It was surprising how well the movie did at the box office. One billion is nothing to sneeze at. Incredible.\n",
      "Yes I especially enjoyed Letitia Wright's performance\n",
      "Didn't she play the tech genius sister? Yeah, I thought her character was very likable and funny. I enjoyed the wardrobe. Their outfits were amazing and beautiful. They really put a lot into it. I thought the clothing seemed a little different from what I'm used to seeing. Now I see the Indian influence.\n",
      "Funny thing about Black Panther is the censored \"praise hanuman!\" in the Indian version\n",
      "Yes, I can understand why they were being so careful about it. I thought it was funny how they thought the Indian people would be offended by the villain praising one of their deities but they felt the opposite way. I guess it would be empowering to hear that. That whole \"black leopard\" thing just sounds crazy. I'm glad they didn't change the name.\n",
      "Yea, the character was created before the black panther party was formed\n",
      "Right, but I'm sure a lot of people don't know that and may have taken issue. I never made the connection between the two myself. What I find the most interesting about the story is that Black Panther is the richest superhero. You have to have an incredible imagination to put all those details into a character like that. The background information is fascinating.\n",
      "Yep, Black Panther is the richest superhero, he has more money than Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark\n",
      "Yeah, richer than just about anyone real or fictional I would guess. I would have guessed Bruce Wayne was the richest superhero but I haven't really been into Marvel until recently. I think it's nice how these young actors get to play superheros their parents grew up with. I had no idea they used real historical information either. The symbols and written script in the movie dated as far back as the fourth century! Wow!\n",
      "Yea, India and Africa have had a lot of cultural exchanges. The Siddhis cane to India in ancient times\n",
      "Both countries have very rich histories. I can imagine what would have become of them if they hadn't been invaded and colonized. Now both countries have major issues with poverty among other things. They were incredibly talented and spiritual. They are now but I just wonder how far they would have come without interference. I never knew India ever had the number one economy in the world!\n",
      "Not only did India have a great economy, they were also very knowledgeable  in mathematics, metallurgy, astronomy, medicine, navigation, water management, and textiles\n",
      "It's not surprising that India still produces so many mathematicians, engineers, and doctors. Centuries later those talents seem to be ingrained culturally. It's amazing that they had such a large university so long ago. The invasion in 1193 didn't stop their progress altogether. That's what I can determination!\n",
      "I found it fascinating how many cultures studied astronomy. Not only did ancient Indians study it so did ancient Babylonians\n",
      "The study of astronomy probably began when ancient cultures realized they could use it to navigate. I didn't realize there were different branches of astronomy. They probably began with observational astronomy and it developed into theoretical as time went on. When they realized there was a lot more going on than just lights in the sky. It's all fascinating but probably above my thinking. All that math and theoretical stuff makes my head hurt. \n",
      "Using astronomy researchers were able to date events such as odysseus taking back the throne of Ithaca\n",
      "I really enjoy historical information like that. It's interesting that it was described in Homer's \"The Odyssey\". Apparently it happened on April 16, 1178 b.c. It's amazing that they can use astronomy to track dates and planets with mathematical precision!\n",
      "It truly is\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you see the movie Black Panther yet?\n",
      "I haven't but I heard it was really good!\n",
      "The character is the richest of all the superheros\n",
      "I can't believe that the symbols and written script in the movie date back to the 4th century! So cool.\n",
      "It is! Buts its a shame that many associate the character's name with the Black Panther party of the 60s\n",
      "I thought it was very cool though that Chadwick was accepted into a summer theater program at oxford university and it was funded by Denzel Washington!!\n",
      "I thought the same thing, It is the coolest real life story to the movie. Denzel once joke that he wanted Chadwick to repay the tuition since the movie was such a success.\n",
      "Do you know what else is a success? Astronomy. Do you know anything about it?\n",
      "Only thing I know about it is what Bill Nye taught me through the tv when I was a kid\n",
      "Well it is super awesome! It's a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena.\n",
      "Astronomy is too complex for me. I have more of a Walt Disney kind of mind. lol\n",
      "I love Disney! What is your favorite movie?\n",
      "Lion King\n",
      "That was the first Disney film to be dubbed into Zulu for its African release!!\n",
      "I am a huge collector of Disney toys. I wish I could get some of the production samples from the toy companies\n",
      "Yeah me too! I love Frozen though.\n",
      "Thats a good one too; its this generations lion king and a instant classic. The song helped to catapult that movie too\n",
      "Yes the soundtrack like many Disney movies helped enhance the film!! \n",
      "This was Disney's first movie with a woman director too.\n",
      "That is so encouraging to hear. I also can't believe that wreck-it-ralph production in the late 1980's\n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi!  Would you like to come to my Black Panther Party?\n",
      "I do not know.  Will there be snacks?  If I say Glory to Hanuman, will you think it rude?\n",
      "BYO on snacks, but with $1 billion earned in global revenues, we have a nice budget for drinks.\n",
      "Thats a fair amount of money for drinks. Cheers. Apparently, in India, the censures removed the saying Glory to Hanuman.\n",
      "Well, I say since Hanuman is one of the most popular gods in India, a party would not be a party without 'em!\n",
      "I have to confess, I have never seen the movie.  I know that Forest Whitaker was in it.  It was kind of funny to see him in Star Wars a few years ago.  The guy is like weeds.\n",
      "His eyes do not point in the same direction. Gives him a distinctive look. I wonder if Denzel Washington ever helped him out like he did for Chad Boseman?\n",
      "Denzel seems to have helped Chad a bit.  Was Chadwick also in star wars as a young Lando?  Now I am not sure if Marvel did the censorship  or if it was India.\n",
      "Good question. There is much mystery in the stars... We might have to muster all of our powers of mathematics, physics, and chemistry to explain the origin of those stars...\n",
      "A lot of interesting things came from studying the stars.  Ancient Babylonians were no slouches.\n",
      "Bill Nye, the science guy and executive director of the planetary society would agree with you.\n",
      "I occasionally look at the moon with a telescope.   I guess that is called observational astronomy.  It would be Theoretical if I thought about the moon from inside the house.\n",
      "I see you a person of much depth and introspection. You would do well in the Iranian town of Saadat Shahr. That is if you came outside to do your star gazing...\n",
      "Should I bring the telescope to your Black Panther Party?  That Iranian town sounds very relaxing.  \n",
      "Sure! Forrest Gump is coming too, and he is bringing shrimp.  You may want to bone up on your command of Homer's The Odyssey. No doubt the topic of using astronomy to triangulate the date of Odysseus's taking back of the throne of  Ithaca will be a hot topic.\n",
      "I am sure it will.  If Carl Sagan shows up, Bill Nye might try and start something.  So, there is that.\n",
      "Sagan talks a lot about those billions and billions of galaxies. I mean, like, how much is there to say about the theoretical and observational basis that serve as the basis for ones analytical models of interplanetary bodies? Some of us would like to talk about football...\n",
      "I am not sure I would like to talk about football.  It is safer than politics though.  Most of the stars we see, they are already dead.  burned out long before their light ever reached us.  Navigating by a dead star is a lost art.\n",
      "So true. And most movie stars can be described the same way.  FYI. Did I tell you to come dressed as any DIsney character?\n",
      "Oh that makes it all the more fun.  I would like to be Ralph as in Wreck it..\n",
      "That's a good one!  See you at the party friend!\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "did you see the Black Panther movie?\n",
      "Yes and I loved did did you know it is the richest superhero?\n",
      "Yes his net worth is $500 million in total\n",
      "Yes even more than Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark\n",
      "Yes. Did you know the symbols in the movie dated back to 4th century\n",
      "Yes they are from a script that is called nsobdi from present day Nigeria\n",
      "Yeah pretty cool. Did you know they censored the praise hanuman utterance?\n",
      "Yes that was for the indian releases because they were afraid to insult them\n",
      "Yeah. Do you like fiction work?\n",
      "I do. Do you know who wrote the oldest example of a cyborg?\n",
      "Yeah that was Edgar Allen Poe, what a guy\n",
      "Yeah I know. Even Caesar wrote fiction in his youth\n",
      "Yes he wrote about Oedipus and Hercules\n",
      "Yeah. Did you know George Martin does not like fiction?\n",
      "Yes he thinks it is a copyright infringement and a bad things for writers to take on\n",
      "Yes interesting thought there though not sure I agree\n",
      "Me either really. Did you know a judge tried to ban a science fiction novel\n",
      "Yes only because the character was black \n",
      "Yeah that is so sad but I guess it was the 50s\n",
      "True. Did you know there is a page that lists characters based on their powers?\n",
      "Yeah it is a wiki page with that list\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you see the Black Panther movie that recently came out?\n",
      "I did, I liked it a lot, I though it was a great movie with greece songs in it. \n",
      "That is cool, I want to see it but haven't done so yet.  I heard it did really well too. \n",
      "Its relatively a new movie, it came out on 2018 and its part of the Marvel Comics franchise.\n",
      "Yeah and I heard in the Marvel world his is the riches superhero there is. \n",
      "Yeah he is the owner of a whole city and his net worth is 5 times bigger than Tony Starks\n",
      "Yeah that is crazy I know Tony has a ton of money!\n",
      "Yeah, around 100 billion, mora than he can spend for sure and Bruce Wayne around 80 billion.\n",
      "That is just way too much.  Did you know the character's name was briefly changed to black leopard? \n",
      "I didnt know that! Black Panther sounds a lot better though, the actor of the movie was sponsored by Denzel Washington, it seems like he couldnt afford going to acting school.\n",
      "Yeah I think I read that somewhere about it, very interesting. I think there will be more Black Panther films in the future based on how well it did. \n",
      "Yeah hopefully there will, I loved the first movie, I want to see how things turn out after Infinity War, I was really happy when I first knew there was going to be a black panther movie, back in 2014\n",
      "Yeah I don't think you are alone there.  I guess the symbols and written script in the movie were based on actual script dating back to the 4th century!\n",
      "Thats really interesting, I might google it later, it would be crazy if Wakanda actually existed.\n",
      "Yeah that would be, I think a college student did a project and made it out the Wakanda was. \n",
      "Yeah I saw that video, it was really funny and the teacher actually believed it.\n",
      "Yeah that was hilarious.  Speaking movies, are you a sci-fi movie fan?\n",
      "I do like sci-fi movies, I love Star Wars and the Starship Troopes novel.\n",
      "Yeah I always loved the Star Wars movies, I still have to see the last two that came out. \n",
      "They are not as good as the old ones but still pretty decent movies, must watch if you have watched the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi!  Did you see the movie Black Panther?  I tried and could not finish it!  The throwback to the old \"Black to the Future\" phrase did not do it for me!\n",
      "Lol yes I watched it I thought it was pretty good but I can see how you would think that. It definitely dominated the pop culture scene and likely will continue to do so. \n",
      "Yea, people loved it!  I wanted to give it a fair shot.  Maybe I will try and watch it again.  Marvel and Disney usually make good movies!\n",
      "Yeah I agree. The main actor Chadwick Boseman was invited to the summer theatre program at Oxford!\n",
      "Wow!  I enjoy the Iron Man movies.  Crazy to think that Tony Stark and his 100 billion pales in comparison to black panther's 500(!) billion!\n",
      "Jeez that's a lot! Dorothy Steel was a 91 year old actress who made her debut in Black Panther.\n",
      "That is amazing!  I did not realize until recently Marvel was using the name black panther before the political party, the black panthers, existed.\n",
      "Yeah I didn't know that either. I wonder if Ryan Coogler, the director, ever though of giving it another title?\n",
      "I am sure they weighed out the pros and cons.  I wonder where the black panther ranks on the wiki page that ranks fictional characters according to their abilities and power.\n",
      "Yeah good question. Marvel must have a lot of characters. They once attempted to create their own independent studio.\n",
      "I am surprised it did not work out.  It is good that a movie like black panther can become such a hit.  In the 1950s, a federal judge tried to actually ban a comic because it featured a black character.\n",
      "Yeah how times have changed. Fiction is definitely popular. The worlds longest piece of fiction is 4 million words!\n",
      "Crazy!  Fiction has always been important to the human race.  Even Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction!\n",
      "Yeah that's a good point. An ancient greek wrote a science-fiction story about aliens 1800 years ago!\n",
      "That is amazing.  Even crazier than Edgar Allen Poe writing the oldest known example of cyborgs!\n",
      "Yeah true. Orson Scott is also popular as he won both the hugo and nebula awards for his books two years in a row!\n",
      "Wow, good for him!  I have never really liked science fiction that much.  Interesting that Starship Troopers is recommended by three of the five US military branches!\n",
      "Oh is it really? Another good read may be Ride by Ray Bradburry because Epcot used it to make one of their rides!\n",
      "Interesting, ill have to check it out!  I live in Florida so I go there a decent amount with my daughter.  It was nice speaking with you today!!\n",
      "Oh awesome! Margaret Cavendish was a science fiction author and a proponent of women's rights! Nice talking to you as well!\n",
      "Good to know, thank you!  Take care!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you watch Ant-Man and the Wasp?\n",
      "I have not seen it yet but I heard its a light comic book film that doesn't take itself seriously\n",
      "Well its a great movie, I liked it , endearing and fun, some of the ratings are unfair but I believe its a good movie\n",
      "Well it's been compared to Deadpool and Gurdian of the Galaxy which I liked and enjoy so I expect it's  a pretty funny movie\n",
      "Yeah, all three great movies, you should really watch it if you liked Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy, I think Marvel Comics has done a great job with the movies\n",
      "Yea and I really enjoy ant man's cast. Paul Rudd is hilarious \n",
      "He is hilarious, great actor, loved him since I watch him in the series Friends, and also Ryan Reynolds killed it with deadpool\n",
      "Michael Pena as Luis is also hilarious, hope he is in Infinity War too\n",
      "He is hilarious, I like when he tells stories, great touch to the movie\n",
      "Yes the cast is awesome and Peyton Reed does a great job at directing it\n",
      "I agree, he does a great job, you know that Ryan Reinolds is also the voice of the mystery villain of the movie\n",
      "No, I had no clue, I will have to be on the lookout then\n",
      "Deadpool described himself as Ryan Reinolds even before he was casted for the role, that was in 2004,\n",
      "That's great casting. It turns out James Cameron and David Fincher really like Deadpool's script\n",
      "Its a nice script, in fact is the highest grossing r-rated film of all time that wasnt directed by either Cameron or Lucas\n",
      "I never knew George Lucas directed a R rated movie, I will have to look that up\n",
      "It seems that way, you know that the video game of the movie costed more than the movie itself!\n",
      "That's crazy but I bet it isn't more expensive than Infinity War. Infinity War was the first film completely shot with Imax digital cameras\n",
      "Wow, I bet that will start a trend, more movies wil be filmed that way, \n",
      "Hopefully, The Avengers do have a big influence like when the increased shawarma sales\n",
      "That is a really cool fact, I guess its because of the ending scene of the movie, all heroes are in a shawarma place\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good morning!  Are you a fan of comic books?\n",
      "I do like superheros but I cant say ive read many comic books.\n",
      "I'm the same way.  Did you like the Deadpool movie?\n",
      "I did!  He is my favorite superhero.  Its crazy that the video game cost more to make than the movie\n",
      "It is.  I wonder if the video game ended up making more than the move?  In a 2004 comic book, Deadpool described himself as \"Ryan Reynolds crossed with a shar-pei\" which led Reynolds to believe he was destined to play the role.\n",
      "He was certainly perfect for it.  He is likely the reason it was the highest grossing film not directed by Cameron or Lucas.\n",
      "I agree.  Did you know that the voice of the mystery villain is also Ryan Reynolds?\n",
      "I didn't.  I thought I recognized something there.  That explains it.  Did you see Infinity War?\n",
      "I did!  It was the first film ever to be shot entirely with digital imax cameras.\n",
      "Wow.  That is neat.  I missed it in theaters.  I heard it caused a notable increase in shawama sales.\n",
      "Interesting.  I thought it was neat that in the movie the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy worked together to stop Thanos from amassing the all-powerful Infinity Stones.\n",
      "The ending killed me.\n",
      "The voice actor who played Jarvis (who also played in the Iron Man series) never was actually seen in the film.  I never noticed that.\n",
      "Me neither\n",
      "Did you know that the waitress Captain America saved is the voice behind Gretchen in Recess?\n",
      "That is where I recognize that voice from.  How neat.  The oringinal hulk, Lou Ferrigno has voiced the hulk for decades.\n",
      "Wow!  I didn't know he was still doing it.  Did you like the Ant Man and the Wasp?\n",
      "I didnt see it.  Want to though\n",
      "I enjoyed it.  It's good for a few laughs.  It only received a rating of 2.5 stars though.\n",
      "really, i heard good things about it.\n",
      "I didn't think it deserved that low of a rating.  It was nice chatting with you this morning.  Hope you have a good day!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you enjoy superhero movies?\n",
      "Yea, I haven't caught Ant-Man and the wasp yet, I hear it's pretty funny and doesn't take itself seriously\n",
      "Well marvel does a good job of injecting humor into its superhero movies and to me this is a plus\n",
      "Yea, I'm interested to see how Lang and Luis running a security firm turns out, they were both great in the first ant-man\n",
      "I mean scott lang has finished his house arrest so it seem like he is in for an adventure\n",
      "Yea, I heard Paul Rudd wrote the script so it shouldn't dissapoint\n",
      "Have you watched any other superhero films?\n",
      "Yea I've seen most of the marvel movies, it's crazy how big and successful they've gotten since Disney purchased them in 2009\n",
      "Did you enjoy deadpool 2?\n",
      "Yea I found it pretty funny, I'm amazed that the Deadpool videogame cost more to make than the movie\n",
      "Well it was the highest grossing r rated film of all time. Of course not directed by cameron or lucas\n",
      "That's strange, I didn't know George Lucas even directed an R rated movie or it was one of the highest grossing ones with that rating\n",
      "Then did you enjoy infinity war?\n",
      "yea I saw it a couple weeks after it was released 2018\n",
      "It is funny how avengers caused a notable increase in shawarma sales\n",
      "Yea I can see how Shawarma sales increased, I've never heard of it before the Avengers came out\n",
      "True I only tried it once and it was decent, but not too memorable otherwise. In any case it was a good movie and the first to entirely be shot with digital imax cameras\n",
      "Yea, too bad jarvis' voice actor has never seen any of the Iron Man or Avengers movies\n",
      "That is a shame. If I voiced something in a movie, I would want to see my efforts\n",
      "Yea, I wonder if Lou Ferrigno watched any of the movies where he voiced the Hulk\n",
      "I mean considering he voiced the character for decades I certainly hope so. In any case, it was a pleasure to talk to you about superhero movies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So do you like Shakespeare?  I read that they coined or popularized many of the phrases we use today.\n",
      "this is true. He wrote many plays and was very popular.\n",
      "Some of the phrases include \"Good riddance, in my heart of hearts, laughing stock, and wild goose chase.\n",
      "Those are all classics. Did you know he died in 1616.\n",
      "No I did not.  I read however that Pocahontas and him were both alive at the same time and died only a year apart.\n",
      "Thats interesting. Wonder if they ever met each other.\n",
      "That would have been an interesting meet up.  I saw that Shakespeare invented the names Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia\n",
      "thats ool. My daughters name is Olivia and my sisters name is jessica. Thanks shakespeare\n",
      "I also just read that Polish composer Tchaikowsky donated his skull to the Royal Shakespeare Company\n",
      "Guess he wants it to be used in a play or something.\n",
      "Yes He was hoping it would be used as a prop for The Skull of Yorick\n",
      "I guess that would be one way to live on.\n",
      "It actually ended up being used in a series of performances of Hamlet at the Courtyard Theater\n",
      "I think hamlet is the more popular of the two anyways.\n",
      "Yes, I'm sure.  They say that his works take on a different meaning when performed with an era-appropriate accent\n",
      "I ould see that. Play it for the time when he wrote it nd it makes more sense. Makes sense to me.\n",
      "So off subject but what do you think about the piano.  It was invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around 1700\n",
      "I kind of wish I could play it. \n",
      "Me too!  This is interesting on April 18, 1930 the BBC decided that there was no news worth reporting so they broadcast piano music instead\n",
      "How many people never listened to that station again after that. Lol.\n",
      "yes, exactly it was an interesting choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you seen the movie Ant-Man and the Wasp? I heard it was rated 2.5 stars\n",
      "I have not actually. did you? are they any good?\n",
      "I didn't see it. I think that there are better movies out there like Deadpool which was so good!!\n",
      "I like deadpool too, ryan reynolds is so good in that\n",
      "He is.  I am not sure how I feel about Paul Rudd as Ant man. He just doesn't seem like a superhero to me. \n",
      "Yeah that is interesting. did you know deadpool described himself as ryan reynold crossed with a shar-pei?\n",
      "No I had not heard that. Did you know that the Deadpool video game cost more to make than the movie?  Crazy!\n",
      "that is crazy. yeah, and that was before ryan was even cast\n",
      "Are you into comics? I forgot that Disney acquired Marvel in 2009. It seems like Disney has a piece of everything@!\n",
      "they sure do. apparently the voice of the mystery villain deadpool is ryan himself\n",
      "I heard that. Surprising. One thing is that Disney doesn't own the rights to the \"big\" chararcters like avengers, x-men, spider-man due to a contract that Marvel signed with Universal Studios.\n",
      "wow, that is amazing. did you know sony had the chance to buy all the superero rights from marvel and passed on it?\n",
      "Wasn't it something to do with them only wanting rights to Spiderman, thinking that movie audiences just cared about Spiderman. That was a mistake. \n",
      "yeah they got spiderman only for $10 million\n",
      "Marvel also created a superhero called Blue Ear who wore hearing aids for a 4 year old boy who didn't like wearing his hearing aids. He had told his mom that superheros don't wear hearing aids. Well so Marvel created one! Pretty cool. \n",
      "that is so heart-warming. good for them. have you heard of Access?\n",
      "No, what is it? \n",
      "a superhero that keeps the universes of marvel and dc separate\n",
      "Oh, for a second there I thought you meant to type the Avengers. Who I have heard of. I mean who doesn't like a movie with Robert Downey Jr., Chris Helmsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Benedict Cumberbatch?  \n",
      "yeah that is a great movie for sure. it was the first movie to be shot with digital imax cameras entirely\n",
      "I love digital imax movies. Well It was nice talking to you. Hope you get to see a good superhero movie soon. This has made me want to go to the movies. \n",
      "Same here, have a good one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How's it going, have you read any Shakespeare? It's kinda strange that no one know the exact date of his birth\n",
      "hi how are you? i wonder how good the birth records were back in those days.\n",
      "Not too good, the best record they have for Shakespeare is his baptism in 1564\n",
      "He lived a full life. I wonder how many hours a day he wrote. He was the most prolific writer ever, i imagine.\n",
      "Yea Shakespeare did right a lot, 39 plays and 154 sonnets\n",
      "Man, that is a lot of play writing. two or three a year, i guess. actors must have loved him. steady work!\n",
      "You know Shakespeare was an actor for a few years, I never knew that \n",
      "I did not know that, but it makes sense. i guess his experience shaped his thinking as a playwrite.\n",
      "Yea, I never knew he had 3 children either and married a lady name Anne Hathaway, I wonder if the kids inherited anything after he passed\n",
      "That is unlikely. boy, that would be tough to be his kid. a long shadow the father would cast.\n",
      "Yea, Shakespeare did coin popular phrases like \"good riddance\" and \"laughing stock\"\n",
      "And i bet audiences immediately understood the meaning of those phrases. He could have gotten rich today coining slogans for advertising. LOL\n",
      "Shakespeare could of also trademark the names he invented like Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia\n",
      "Those are classic names, and very popular in England. I guess that those characters had distinct personalities as well.\n",
      "Yea, it's crazy how Shakespeares writing takes on different meaning depending on the era-appropriate accent is used\n",
      "I cant even imagine how many accents would be involved. bewildering. \n",
      "I guess that's the good thing about playing a piano, no accents. Crazy it was invented all the way back in 1700\n",
      "The piano has developed so much over the years. a wonderful instrument. universal. \n",
      "Yea, it's pretty cool the same piano was used to record \"Hey Jude\" and \"Bohemian Rhapsody\"\n",
      "I bet there is some magic in those keys. Anyway, great chat!\n",
      "You too, have a good one\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, how are you.  Are you a movie fan?  Have you seen Deadpool 2?\n",
      "I watch movie once in a while.  YOu?\n",
      "I am a huge movie/Marvel fan.  In Deadpool 2, there is a scene where Deadpool kills Ryan Reynolds (who plays Deadpool).\n",
      "I have not watched the movie.  But I know that the deadpool videogame cost more to make than the deadpool the movie\n",
      "Oh my god, Really???  That is crazy.  Deadpool has made more money than any other R rated movie, not directed by James Cameron or George Lucas.\n",
      "I am a fan of George Lucas, and this fact really adds to my surprising\n",
      "James Cameron who is friends with Tim Miller, who directed Deadpool, read the script and helped push the film on Fox executives.\n",
      "Btw, do you know that the voice of the mystery villain in deadpool 2 is Ryan Reynolds\n",
      "I had saw that somewhere. Man, Sony screwed up big time. In 1998, marvel offered the cinematic rights of almost all of its characters to sony for a mere $25 million. sony rejected the offer, and only purchased the rights to spiderman for $10 million believing that movie audiences would only care about him.WHAT A MISTAKE   \n",
      "I concur.  I do not know what really happened to Sony.  Their business and reputation is almost gone on the market\n",
      "Access is a character owned by Marvel and DC.  The characters sole purpose is to keep Marvel and DC universes seperate.  LOL\n",
      "I know, it is hilarious.  By any chance, have you watched Avengers:  Infinity War.  It was very good\n",
      "I have seen it like 10 times.  This is funny!  Marvel had a court battle and successfully argued that toys\" instead of the higher rate for dolls because they are not human. \n",
      "Wow, you watched it 10 times.  You must like it a lot.  Did you know that the Avengers:  infinity war is the first fim ever to be shot entirely with digital imax cameras\n",
      "I think I read that somewhere.  I read a very good story awhile back.  Marvel made up a superhero called Blue Ear solely for a 4 year old boy who didn't like wearing his hearing aids\n",
      "I think this fact is very believable.  And it is a cute story also.  \n",
      "That made me like Marvel even better.  I also think it's funny that Shawarma sales went up after the Avengers movie\n",
      "Do you think it was a coincidence or were they somehow related\n",
      "It was all due to the show.  The actor who voices Jarvis Has never actually been seen in the films.\n",
      "Got it. Also, did you know that Deadpool described himself as \"ryan reynolds crossed with a shar-pei in a 2004 comic book series,which led to the fact that reynold believed he was destined for the role\n",
      "Well, it has been great chatting. Merry Christmas.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you study Shakespeare in school?\n",
      "No, I did no. Did you?\n",
      "I remember Romeo and Juliet plays. He actually invented the names, Jessica, Miranda, and Olivia.\n",
      "That's cool!\n",
      "Yeah, did you ever watch the movie Pocahontas?\n",
      "Sure did.  I read they were both alive at the same time and died within a year of each other.\n",
      "Yeah, I found that out recently. I never knew Pocahontas was a real person.\n",
      "Really?  \n",
      "Yeah, I had no idea. I'm not sure who this is but, a polish composer Andre Tchaikowsky donated his skull to Shakespeare. Andre hoped he would use it as a prop.\n",
      "It got used in a series of performances of Hamlet at the Courtyard Theatre.\n",
      "Well, that is awesome, I guess he did get what he wanted. \n",
      "I guess?  They say Shakespeare's works take on a different meaning when performed with an era appropriate accent instead of a modern one.  I think I'd like to watch and listen to one.\n",
      "I would too. I wonder if he could play piano?\n",
      "He may have, he seemed very talented.  Can you play piano?\n",
      "Not at all, I liked to think I could as a child though. Can you?\n",
      "Actually, I trained for 13 years and I'm pretty good at it.  I read somewhere that the BBC decided that there was no news worth reporting on April 18.1930, so they played piano music instead.  I wish America's media would take that cue some days.\n",
      "Oh wow, that is awesome. I believe I read this somewhere. A group of climbers, climbed the tallest mountain in Britain and there was a piano on the top! \n",
      "I wonder how it got there?  Very interesting.\n",
      "I have no idea, do you think it worked still?\n",
      "Probably not, pianos are very fickle instruments.  Lol\n",
      "I'm sure you know who Freddie Mercury is. He used the same piano as Paul Mccartney to record bohemian rhapsody. \n",
      "That's cool.  Well, it's been nice chatting, I have to go now.  I'll talk to you later, friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a fan of any forms of art?\n",
      "Yes! I enjoy art in the form of music. I especially enjoy the tune of the piano. What about you?\n",
      "I love piano music, and music in general. I actually played piano when I was a kid. Do you play any instruments?\n",
      "Oh wow, what age did you start and do you still play? No I do not play any instruments, I wished I played the guitar. \n",
      "I started when I was six and played until I was seventeen, but then we moved and I had to give up my piano. Haven't played since, sadly, but I loved it. Maybe you should try guitar!\n",
      "Oh no! That's terrible! Piano sounds are beautiful, what made you start learning the instrument? I have given the guitar a few tries, but without the foundation of music, it is so difficult to play. I admire those self-taught people.\n",
      "It was actually my mom's idea - she wanted us all to learn an instrument, so she bought us a piano and some books and taught us at home. I know what you mean about not having a foundation of music. I felt so clumsy and clueless starting out.\n",
      "Wow! I really want my kids to play an instrument and would love them to learn the piano, were you apprehensive to it at first? I don't want to force my kids but when I hear about the statistics of the benefits classical music, I really want my kids to learn it.\n",
      "It wasn't really intimidating since I started so young. It was just another thing to learn, like math or English, and it was fun too. What kid doesn't like making noise? It also helped that my mom let me play on my own in between instructional periods.\n",
      "Great insight! That's very true, what scares me is asking these kids to sit and focus their attention on it. Thanks for the info! I can't believe that there is a piano at the top of Britain's highest mountain! Would the keys still function if it snowed?!\n",
      "As long as the piano stays closed so snow doesn't clog the chords inside, it probably would play just fine. Unless it's an electric piano. Then I think snow might cause some electrical issues!\n",
      "Oh wow! That's super neat. Do you enjoy poetry? So many people speculated about Shakespeare's sexuality, whatever it was, he wrote some great pieces.\n",
      "I love poetry. I've read some of Shakespeare's sonnets (and his plays!), and they have such creative, lyrical beauty. I didn't know there was speculation about his sexuality, just that he was married to Anne Hathaway.\n",
      "I wondered if the celebrity Anne Hathaway's name is inspired from that. I had no idea Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time! They would've seemed to live in different eras to me.\n",
      "Pocahontas and Shakespeare being contemporaries is surprising to think about. I had the same surprised reaction to finding out Anne Frank and Martin Luther King Jr. were born in the same year.\n",
      "Yeah! What?! That's crazy! Is there a particular piece of work you enjoy of Shakespeare's?\n",
      "My favorite play of his is Hamlet, with Macbeth a close runner-up. I can't say I have a favorite sonnet, though. Each has its unique appeal. Do you have a favorite?\n",
      "Yeah, those are really good ones. I don't typically have a favorite but enjoyed each one of them. I also find it interesting that he invented the names Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia, those are really common names nowadays!\n",
      "Olivia is one of the names my brother and his wife are considering using for their new baby if it ends up being a girl. I'll have to tell my brother he has Shakespeare to thank!\n",
      "That's wonderful! All the Olivia's I have known in my life are stunning and gorgeous! It really matches the name! What type of name is in the name bank if it is a boy?\n",
      "My brother wants to name it after him, but my sister-in-law prefers Jackson. I like her idea better!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi\n",
      "Hi! How are you? Have you seen the new Deadpool sequel yet? I hear its amazing.\n",
      "No I haven't been able to see it yet. The first one was great, but I haven't been able to see the second yet.\n",
      "I'm not usually so into super hero stuff. But there are so many great movies coming out, I can't help It. Have you seen Infinity War? Its the first film to ever be shot entirely with imax cameras!\n",
      "I haven't yet. I bet that's pretty intense. There are a ton of actors in it; almost too much to follow. I guess that's why they needed the Imax cameras, huh?\n",
      "I guess so, I guess the voice actor that plays Iron Man has never ever seen the movies.\n",
      "Actually, the character Jarvis hasn't been in the films. But that's a bit of a fib because Jarvis becomes Vision and is played by the same actor, Paul Bettany\n",
      "That's interesting, thanks for clearing that up. Did you know that Disney isn't allowed to show big marvel characters east of the Mississippi due to a contract they signed?\n",
      "It's kind of funny how the ownership of the Marvel properties works. Sony still owns Spiderman so he only shows up if Sony let's Disney have him. This is why his appearances in Iron Man and Avengers are really short.\n",
      "That's so weird. They created a character called Blue Ear for a little boy who was afraid to wear his hearing aids and told his mom \"But Super heroes don't wear hearing aids.\" So Marvel made one that did. So sweet.\n",
      "Yeah, overall they really care about their fans. And there are a lot of them at this point. Did you know there are over 19 films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? And more every year!\n",
      "I had no idea. I didn't even realize there were so many characters until not too long ago. I didn't watch or read comic books when I was a kid, so I was only familiar with Superman and Batman. I had never heard of Deadpool, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, or any of those guys. I bet Sony wishes they had taken Marvel up on their offer to buy them out for 25 million. I think SOny thought people would only care about Spiderman.\n",
      "I think at the time, they were right. the mcu didn't really take off until Iron Man in 2008. Still, I bet someone at Sony got yelled at for that one.\n",
      "What's the deal with that character Access? I head that he is owned by both companies and his job is solely to make sure that the two companies' universes separate?\n",
      "I don't know, but its too bad we couldn't see a DC/Marvel cross over. Superman meets the Avengers? Sign me up.\n",
      "I bet that would be fun. My husband and son would love it if they did that. I guess Marvel argued successfully in court that mutants were not people, and so they got to pay the lower rate on X-Men toys instead of the higher rate for dolls. SO much interesting trivia.\n",
      "That's kind of ironic considering much of the X-Men story is about how mutants are the same as humans and deserve equality.\n",
      "Ha, that is ironic. I was thinking that that might send a weird message to their child fans.\n",
      "I think people overthink what children might think. However, I think there are certain characters that just are not for kids. Like Deadpool. The merc with a mouth. It was really a good thing they rate it R.\n",
      "That's what husband said. I guess the first one was the highest grossing R rated feature of all time after The Passion of the Christ. My husband said it definitely wasn't a kids movie. \n",
      "I heard 2 takes it even further with the crudeness. I enjoyed the first one, it definitely didn't hold back, but it also didn't feel forced. Just felt like this is the character and this is the life he leads which is full of sex, violence, and swearing.\n",
      "I used to think that kind of thing was funny, but now that I'm getting older it seems very distasteful to me.  I guess I probably just don't want my kid saying stuff like that. I thought SuperHeroes were supposed to be for kids. Although, I guess maybe the movies are for the people that USED to be kids.\n",
      "Maybe that is the appeal of someone like Deadpool. He's a superhero, but he's not for kids. They are probably trying to capture a whole new audience that doesn't include kids.\n",
      "That makes more sense. Kids don't have any money, you have to get the parents roped back in if you want them to buy the kids all the expensive toys and movies and stuff. Unless they're mutant toys, because those are cheaper.\n",
      "They also have been doing on so long that they have a nice audience of young adults who grew up with all the Marvel movies that they can now afford to buy a lot of useless \"toys\" themselves.\n",
      "Yup. My husband has a bigger collection of SUperhero stuff than he probably ever did when he was a kid.  They must make SO much off of merchandise alone.\n",
      "Their licensing department really went crazy. But people buy it so maybe not.\n",
      "I read the Avengers caused a notable increase in Shawarma sales, why would that be, do you know?\n",
      "I think they make a big point of eating it at some point. It really shows how big of an impact the MCU has, huh?\n",
      "It really does, lol\n",
      "I don't think you get to be almost 20 films strong and not have at least some influence on society.\n",
      "No, I don't suppose you do. People are so into the shows and movies they watch these days. Its kind of crazy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, do you watch marvel movies?\n",
      "I do. I've pretty much seen them all and I consider myself a fan. You?\n",
      "I have watched most of them. Which one is your favorite?\n",
      "I would have to say Thor. I think they cast it perfectly with Chris Hemsworth too. What's your favorite?\n",
      "I also enjoy thor altough I really did like infinity war. Did you know that Ant man made his debut before spiderman, thor and even hulk?\n",
      "I've heard that. Did you see Ant Man - interesting to see Paul Rudd as a super hero lol\n",
      "Agreed. The infinity gauntlet was originally on thor's left hand in the comics but was originally right handed.\n",
      "Did you see the first Infinity Wars movie?\n",
      "I have, I really enjoyed it. It was nice to see all of the marvel characters come together. Have you?\n",
      "I did. Since half of them disappeared, how do you think it's going to end? I have a feeling Ant-Man is involved.\n",
      "Yeah, ant man was shown with a machine in the trailer. I believe that they are going to travel back in time to fix their mistakes.\n",
      "That would be pretty cool. I wonder if Captain Marvel will figure in. What do you think?\n",
      "Possibly. I have recently watched that movie as well, a great addition to the marvel universe.\n",
      "Oh really already? That just came out Friday right?! I haven't had the chance yet but want to.\n",
      "Yeah, I booked some tickets and went to watch it yesterday. Don't worry, I will not spoil anything.\n",
      "Haha okay. You can spoil one thing though, were any other characters from the Marvel Universe in it?\n",
      "Well, I do not have the exact number but there were at least two.\n",
      "Which two?!\n",
      "Iron man (briefly) and hulk\n",
      "That's awesome. I can't wait to see it. Crazy how Disney owns Marvel Entertainment now. Except in theme parks lol\n",
      "Haha, yep. Anyways, thank  you for your time! It was nice chatting with you!\n",
      "Thank you as well. Have a great night!\n",
      "You too!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi! Are you current with all the marvel movies?\n",
      "Some of them. I loved Thor Ragnarok and Black Panther, but some of them are a little dull. What about you?\n",
      "I am way behind. I haven't even seen Iron Man 2 yet, although I did watch the first thor movie... I am interested in watching them, but once yo fall behind, the numbers mount quickly!\n",
      "And they're all connected! I read an article pointing out the plot points that culminated in Avengers: Infinity War and it  blew my mind. That one has quite a cast of impressive actors. I'd never imagined Idris Elba and Paul Bettany in superhero movies, but the MCU is a whole different beast.\n",
      "I would agree totally. There have been like 19 MCU movies in the last ten years... That's two per year! \n",
      "I have friends that have watched them all. I can't imagine having the time to do that! The fact that they're now releasing them so quickly and close together really keeps the excitement up. The last 3 movies that came out did better than previous titles,  and I wonder if they're going to keep doing that- just to keep ticket sales booming.\n",
      "As long as there are sure-fire $ to be made, Hollywood will invest. And with the noticeable trend that pushing through one great story after another yields steady revenues, I think I will stay far behind...\n",
      "Do watch Thor: Ragnarok. It's so much fun. It's a different tone than most super hero movies, because the director, Taika Waititi let the cast improvise. It's very loose and enormously fun.\n",
      "That sounds great!  Was Ragnorok the second or third in the Thor series? \n",
      "It was the second. I think. I might be wrong, but it's definitely the most memorable one for me. I do enjoy Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Can you imagine if he would have been cast as Thor? I can't get my head around that.\n",
      "After  watching the first thor ovie (2011) I cannot imagine Loki and Thor any different than who played them. What else can you tell me about this?about \n",
      "Well, in thinking about it, Ragnarok was the third movie in the Thor series. I had forgotten the second one entirely! Hiddleston put on 50 pounds of muscle to play Thor, and I would like to see what that looks like on him. Apparently he screen tested, so it's got to be on the internet somewhere!\n",
      "Really?  What is the Infinity Gauntlet?\n",
      "It's the glove-like thing that Thanos collects the infinity stones into. The stones are hidden all around the universe and once he has them, he can wreak havoc on mankind. They're sort of hidden in all of the MCU movies, in one way or another. \n",
      "Bizarre, but interesting! I remember watching all the X-men movies, and really connecting with the humanity of the mutant characters. Is then shocked me when I learned that Marvel successfully argued in court that mutants are not people in order to reduce cost of producing X-men toys.  Seems ironic!\n",
      "Right?! It's kind of anti-Xmen, because they are people! I'd love to have a great X Men movie sometime. I'd love it if they were added to the MCU, because there are some excellent Xmen characters. It's weird that in Orlando, there are lots of Marvel characters at Disney World, but some of them are only at Universal Studios. \n",
      "Yeah, strange to have \"rights\" to imaginary figures... Maybe that is one reason why SOny balked at the chance to buy cinematic rights to most of the Marvel characters for a mere $25 mil. \n",
      "They have to be kicking themselves! And then they spent $10 million only on Spiderman?! There are such good stories to be told that are already written in the comics!\n",
      "Yeah. So many characters and so many stories, it is not surprising that the Marvel and DC created a character, Access, that straddles the two reality to help them to keep track of and keep separate the two universes.  If they need help keeping this stuff straight, I have't got a chance!\n",
      "I remember when he was created- they did a crossover between Marvel and DC. It was a clever idea. I know I'd watch a movie about BlueEar, the superhero who wears hearing aids. \n",
      "Yeah. I would even watch a movie about Jarvis!  You know, the actor who voiced the Jarvis role in Iron Man and Infinity Wars has never seen the films. Maybe I can get him to take me and we can catch up on these films together?  Nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, have you seen the movie \"Black Panther, If yes, did you like it?\n",
      "I did enjoy the film, although not as much as Avengers: Infinity War with its record breaking opening.\n",
      " I didn't like it as much either, do you know how Black Panther is partly responsible for success of Avengers: Infinity War?\n",
      "Hard to say for sure, but opening 10 weeks prior may have helped the big film's succeed.\n",
      "Did you know Avengers: Infinity War made more money than Star Wars?\n",
      "I heard that!   $250 million is a lot of money!\n",
      "Yes, have you seen Iron Man, if yes did you like it?\n",
      "Yes.    Even after ten years it holds up quite well!\n",
      "That's true, I even like the actor in Iron Man as much as the movie itself. He is one of my favorite actor. \n",
      "Do you know the name of the company that published Iron Man comics?\n",
      "No, I am not sure, do you know or have any idea? I knew the artist I think, because I like drawing cartoons.\n",
      "I believe it was Marvel Comics Group, since they talk about the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n",
      "Do you have a favorite comic hero, if yes, who is your favorite?\n",
      "I like the X-men because they are mutants, not people.\n",
      "I like X-men also with so many different powers, but my favorite is The Incredible Hulk.\n",
      "Did you know Ant man came before Thor, Hulk and Spider-man!\n",
      "What do you mean, that Ant man made more money? I saw Ant man I like it. I was surprise at first, but the movie was really good.\n",
      "No, the character was created before the others.    Interesting given the role of Thor in the Avengers.\n",
      "Oh really, I didn't know that. I need to follow comics more closely.\n",
      "Everyone should!    The avengers movie even resulted in an increase in shawarma sales due to the brief scene!\n",
      "Back to Black Panther, I was really surprised the many awards this movie won. \n",
      "Surely something no one would have seen when Marvel started in 1939!\n",
      "That's true, did you know in 1961 the Fantastic four was created?\n",
      "Stan Lee and Steve Ditko were geniuses in their own way!    Thanks for the chat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you seen Thor? \n",
      "hi how are you? i have not seen thor?\n",
      "I've seen it. The first one is good, the second one, not so much. \n",
      "I dont really like the superhero films. too many explosions, too many battle scenes. it gets old.\n",
      "Yeah, they get old really quick. I'm in the same camp. I did like how the Batmans with Bale were done though. What about you?\n",
      "I did like Bale's batman. and i also like Spider-man 2. more story, less CG stuff.\n",
      "Yeah, they were good. I think it is mostly the Marvel films that are getting old. \n",
      "Yeah, i think that a bunch are slated to come out over the next few years. I will take a pass.\n",
      "Me too. I got tired after Ironman 2. \n",
      "I think that the storylines get played out and there isnt enough to keep it going. they use sfx to pad out the plot.\n",
      "Exactly. They also need to stop remaking old films. \n",
      "Yeah, that is a tired way to fill up a slate. i did like the remake of a star is born, but usually i dont like remakes.\n",
      "Interesting. I didn't see that one. The remake of Total Recall was so terrible. LOL\n",
      "Total Recall? why would you remake that? Also robocop. no need for a remake.\n",
      "They put Collin Farrel in it. It was freaking terrible. Same with the Robocop remake.\n",
      "I guess if they make enough money on it, it is worth it. there is also the aftermarket, the streaming, the TV viewing. Oy.\n",
      "Yeah, that is true. It seems like Marvel is the worst at it though. \n",
      "Marvel was bought by disney, i believe. they are milking for everything they can. kids will watch anything it seems.\n",
      "Yeah, that they will. My nephew watches Peppa the Pig. Mindless nonsense. LOL. Well nice chatting with you!\n",
      "Yes, i enjoyed chatting! Time to watch mindless nonsense.\n",
      "Take it easy!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello do you like Black Panther?\n",
      "Great movie.  Saw it twice in theatres.  It made a whole bunch of money\n",
      "Nice,  yes I recently watched it again since I found it on netflix,  great movie.  Did you know Black Panther is the wealthiest super hero?\n",
      "Well he does lead Wakanda, which is rich as could be, so it makes sense\n",
      "Yeah he owns a country lol \n",
      "There are lots of rich marvel comics characters though.  Iron man has a lot of money, and the X-men live in a mansion.\n",
      "Yeah thats true.  Looks like a lot of them just inherited the money \n",
      "And now the actors that play the characters are getting rich.  Marvel movies make serious box office cash\n",
      "I know right.  Have you seen infinity war?\n",
      "I have.  It was also great.  Josh Brolin did a great job as Thanos.  \n",
      "Yeah he does a good bad guy you want to hate lol I think the next one comes out next month\n",
      "I know.  It is hard to believe marvel almost sold the movie rights to all its characters back in the 1990s.\n",
      "Yeah I know right.  Did you know the avengers caused a spike in shawarma sales lol \n",
      "I remember seeing avengers and wanting to try shawarma afterwards.  Still haven't tried it\n",
      "Me either lol the guy who voiced Jarvis has never seen any of the movies lol\n",
      "He does not need to watch the movies to cash the check I guess\n",
      "true,  yeah hes on vacation when they are in theatres lol\n",
      "I think my favorite Marvel film was Thor Ragnarok.  It was very fun and improvised.\n",
      "That movie was freaking hilarious!  i think it was definitely the best out of the thor series!  I still really like the first avengers movie out of all the marvel ones,  thor ragnarok is my second favorite,  I think ant man would be my third. \n",
      "I do like that they are able to have a good amount of comedy in those films.  Tom Hiddleston does a great Loki\n",
      "He is so perfect for that role.  To think he auditioned for Thors role first.  \n",
      "Yeah, he put on 50 pounds of muscle for nothing.  Been good chatting with you\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you into the marvel comics\n",
      "I love them yeah, my favorite hero is Iron Man do you have a favorite one?\n",
      "Iron man for sure. Growing up he was awesome then watching the first movie really set the tone.\n",
      "Yeah Robert Downey Jr, was the man for the role, he really made the franchise popular, he's a great actor. \n",
      "for sure. I like marvel, they even create superheros for a kid who was deaf, blue ear\n",
      "Havent heard of that hero before but its a great thing to do, helping a kid and his family out like that. \n",
      "I agree. did you hear in 1998 marvel offered the rights to its characters for movies and they declined\n",
      "Who declined them? I bet they are regretting that decision big time by now each hero is worth hundreds of millions. \n",
      "Sony did for 25 million dollars. They could have made so much money! I think Black Panther alone made 1 billion dollars\n",
      "Yeah and then theres also Thor that movie made a lot of money as well. Do you like Tom Hiddleston, the actor that playes the role of Loki?\n",
      "Yea he was good. I didn't like the first 2 thors, but ragnorak was awesome! Do you like him\n",
      "I liked them all but I agree Ragnarok is the best so fast, so funny I like how the Hulk was in it as well. \n",
      "For sure, that what one of my favorite parts lol. Did you know ant man made his debut before the big characters did\n",
      "I didnt know that Ant Man is another great hero, did you watch Infinity War?\n",
      "I loved that movie, crazy what happened at the end. Do you think they will all come back in End Game?\n",
      "I think they will, at least Spiderman since theres another movie planed for this same year. Do you know who Jarvis is?\n",
      "I know Jarvis, I think he was played by Paul Bettany \n",
      "Yeah well Paul Bettany has never seen the films, how crazy is that, he's a big icon of the saga and hasnt bothered to watch his own work in action. \n",
      "wow, how do you not see yourself lol. I would watch a movie I was in like 100 times! Doesn't he play Vision in infinity war also?\n",
      "He does play vision yeah and I would watch it as well specially if it was a great series like the Avengers, those movies will be popular years to come. \n",
      "right! It was so nice chatting with you. Enjoy your night!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you watched Avengers Infinity War?\n",
      "No, is it any good? \n",
      "I haven't watched it either but I heard it is a really good one. The female characters have developed in this movie as well.\n",
      "Interesting, who is the voice actor? \n",
      "I'm not really sure but there are fight scenes where there are women characters only. Seems different than other Marvel stuff.\n",
      "Yeah, seems pretty cool. have you seen the film Thor? \n",
      "I think I have, a long time ago. Thor got stripped of his powers, and Thr had to prove he was working.\n",
      "Yeah, I saw it. I thought it was ok. Did you know the spaceships were named after classic australian holden cars? \n",
      "Sorry, meant worthy, not working. Guess I'm more tired than I thought. I liked Ant Man. Apparently Ant Man made his Marvel debut before Thor and some other characers.\n",
      "Ant Man is interesting. Did you like Thor 2? \n",
      "I don't think I knew there was a Thor 2. These movies come out faster than I can keep up with them.\n",
      "Yeah, they come out a lot. Pretty crazy huh? I saw it, not as good as the first one. \n",
      "Tom Hidleston was screen tested for the role of Thor. He gained 50 pounds of muscle for the role. But they decided he would be better for Loki in Avengers.\n",
      "Interesting. What about the incredible hulk, did you see that one? \n",
      "I can't remember, was there a movie? I feel like I used to watch a Hulk series when I was a kid.\n",
      "yeah, I used to too. I saw the one with Edward Norton, horrid. \n",
      "I want to see Infinity War because it was the first film to be shot entirely with digital imax cameras.\n",
      "Wow, that would be pretty cool. Do you have to see it in an imax though? \n",
      "Hmm, not sure about that. I haven't even watched Avengers Age of Ultron. Lou Ferrino who played hulk in the 1970s series, had voiced the character up till that movie.\n",
      "Yes, I remember Lou Ferringo. Apparently Michael Jackson tried to buy Marvel Comics. \n",
      "And Sony turned down an offer to buy the characters. I'm in the mood to watch a movie now. Catch you later!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you like comic books like Thor or the Avengers?\n",
      "I'm not big on comic books but I like Marvel movies though. Did you know that in 1998 Marvel offered film rights to Sony for almost its entirely library but Sony only took Spider-Man thinking that it'd be the only character audiences would like?\n",
      "Pretty short-sighted of Sony.  It's great the Marvel created a superhero named Blue Ear to help a child get used to hearing aids.  \n",
      "I want a movie about Access - that superhero is meant just to keep DC & Marvel Universes separate!\n",
      "Is that superhero a lawyer?  Did you know Ant Man made his marvel debut before Spiderman, Hulk, Thor and Iron-man?\n",
      "No way. Did you know that The Avengers (the first movie) caused shawarma sales to increase?\n",
      "No, I didn't.  Did you know Hugin and Munin, Odin's ravens, appear during Thor and Loki's argument on the mountain?\n",
      "I didn't even know they had names. As a film buff though it's neat to know that Infinity War was the first film ever to be shot entirely with digital IMAX Camras.\n",
      "Interesting.  Also interesting: the voice actor who played Jarvis in Iron Man and the Avengers never actually has seen the films?\n",
      "Well the waitress Captain America saves in Avengers 1 voiced Gretchen in the cartoon Recess. Did you grow up with that show as a kid?\n",
      "Nope.  Did you know 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron was the 19th film in the MCU?\n",
      "I've lost count at this point. I do know that Thor Ragnarok's dialogue was 80% improvised.\n",
      "That's commendable.  I wonder how many takes that took.  I didn't know DC and Marvel co-owned \"Access\" \n",
      "Like I said, I'd love a movie about him but given the rivalry between DC and Marvel I'm not so sure that will happen.\n",
      "Yeah. I didn't realize Paramount distributed films produced by Marvel Studios. \n",
      "Paramount stopped distribution when Disney acquired Marvel in 2009. Disney bought Paramount out. \n",
      "Disney has really changed through the years.  I wonder what Walt would think?  I wonder what the founders of Marvel would think for that matter.  They started in 1939 as Timely Publications.\n",
      "Wow, that's a long time ago. I don't think it was until 1961 they became known as Marvel Comics.\n",
      "I used to like the Fantastic 4 when I was a kid.  I guess those superheros were created by many people (e.g., Jack Kirby and Stan Lee).\n",
      "I'll leave you with this: Lou Ferrigno, who played the hulk in the original 1970s series, still voices the character today!\n",
      "Good for him!  That's a long time.  Thanks for the chat, you were excellent!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Avengers Infinity War was a great movie, I really loved that film\n",
      "Yes, Lou Ferrigno has been voicing the hulk for decades. Do you like Marvel Comics?\n",
      "I love Marvel Comics, Marvel Studios is leaving a legacy behing, great villains such as Thanos and great heros like Steve Rogers, Stark\n",
      "I know, Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel Entertainment. But, Disney does not own rights to Big, X-men, Spider-man.\n",
      "Yeah i guess those characters are too expensive to buy but I think eventually they will buy the whole franchise\n",
      "Probably, Its interesting the voice actor who played Jarvis in Iron Man series and Avengers has not seen the films.\n",
      "Thats funny just like how The Avengers caused an increase in shawarma sales. \n",
      "I really want to see the Movie, \"Blue Ear\"  A 4 year old that had earring issues.\n",
      "I did hear about that I think that is great that Marvel created a hero just to help out that kid and his mom, maybe Blue Ear can be in a Thor movie\n",
      "That would be great! I know, so cute, the boy told his mom, \"superheroes don't wear hearing aids.\"\n",
      "Yeah it is cure so do you also like Thor, have you seen his films?\n",
      "Yes, I do! I didn't know Ant man made his debut before Spider-man, Hulk Thor and Iron-man.\n",
      "Really? I guess Ant Man wasnt popular back then,  I love Loki, his a great villain/hero/trickmaster\n",
      "Agree, Wow, Tom Hiddeston gain 50 pounds of muscle for the film.\n",
      "I think he nailed the role of Loki, he was considered for the role of Thor at first, did you watch Thor Ragnarok?\n",
      "Yeah, interesting about the infinity gauntlet during the movie being right-handed, in the comics its left-handed.\n",
      "That is funny,, the film had a great director, Thor was directed by Kenneth Branagh, I think he made a great job directing the film\n",
      "I do too! Thor had so many good actors in it. Anthony Hopkins is one of my favorites.\n",
      "Anthony Hopkins was Odin right? too bad he died in one of the movies, I thiink it was the Ragnarok film\n",
      "Sony rejected the 25 million offer for Marvels cinematic rights in 1998. Good chat!!\n",
      "I bet they are regretting that decision by now, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The movie Thor was very good.  Did you know that Tom Hiddleston tried out for the role of Thor?\n",
      "I didn't know that until I read the information about the movie just now. It's very interesting though!\n",
      "I try to imagine him as Thor. I guess it could work.  Have you seen the movie?\n",
      "Yes, I have seen the movie. but I could not imagine him as Thor. I like him much better as Loki. Have you seen the movie?\n",
      "I have and i agree.  He makes a very good Loki.  Did you know some of the dialogue was improvised?\n",
      "I did not know that until I read the facts. I like that they did that, because I like when the real actors are more involved with a movie. But they did mess up with the infinity gauntlet being right handed instead of left handed. \n",
      "I can't remember what that is.\n",
      "The infinity gauntlet was what Thanos wore on his hand in the movie. Like a golden glove. Do you like Marvel or DC better?\n",
      "I like Marvel better.  I have seen one or two of the Avengers movies.  Iron Man is great!  You?\n",
      "Oh yes, Marvel is much better! I love all the Marvel characters and their stories. I've seen pretty much all the Marvel movies. My all time favorite is Thor though! I didn't know that Disney cannot show the the big marvel characters in their parks. Did you?\n",
      "Not until now. It seems like an odd contract to sign that they can't show them east of the Mississippi.\n",
      "Yes, very weird. I'm surprised they haven't paid enough money to Marvel to be allowed to show the big Marvel characters. What is more surprising is the fact that the cinema rejected the offer of marvel's characters except for spider man. Guess they didn't know how much a hit all the marvel stories would be.\n",
      "True.  I bet they are kicking themselves now!  Did you know about the character, Access?  I never heard of that before!\n",
      "Yes, for sure kicking themselves now. A lot of money lost on that decision. No, I haven't heard of Access either. I want to learn more though for sure! Isn't it neat that Marvel made a superhero for a boy who had to wear hearing aids? That's so cool of Marvel.\n",
      "It is and it gives me more respect for Stan Lee which probably had a hand in it.  I would like to know, though, how Marvel was able to argue that x-men are not human?\n",
      "Yes, for sure! They are mostly human but just with mutant genes. Guess since they are different they found a loophole to avoid paying the higher rates\n",
      "Who knew there was a loophole for fictional characters!\n",
      "Haha, for sure! I guess people can become very creative when it comes to different ways avoiding to pay more money. I think it's so cool that Avengers infinity war was shot entirely with digital imax cameras. So cool!\n",
      "That is cool! It was the first one ever to be shot that way too!\n",
      "Yes, that is true! Makes me wonder if future Marvel movies will be shot with entirely with digital imax cameras now since that one did so well.\n",
      "They probably will.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you ever read comics?\n",
      "I have read some. Mostly online. I was never a Marvel fan until the movies came out though. Unless it was someone big like Spiderman. It amazing how release times of movies can affect each other.\n",
      "Spiderman is very popular. The rights cost Sony $10 mill\n",
      "They seem like a company who should make that much. They created a superhero for a 4 year old boy, just so he would be more comfortable about his hearing aids.\n",
      "Isn't that a great thing to do. I love that.\n",
      "It is, the hero's name was Blue Ear. I wonder what his powers were? Michael Jackson wanted to play Spiderman.\n",
      "Michael seemed to want to be a lot of things.\n",
      "Isn't that the truth. He tried to buy Marvel in the 1990's, just so he could produce and star in Spiderman. He was an add one. At least Marvel is smart and it didn't happen. They're really smart for trademarking \"super-hero\" and \"super-villain.\"\n",
      "He could have had some unusual moves. LOL\n",
      "The ability to moon walk!\n",
      "Or to lean way back or forward. LOL\n",
      "Crazy. Good thing they avoided him though, because they went on to make movies like Thor, Avengers, and Black Panther.\n",
      "I drew a portrait of Thor even though I have never watched the movie.\n",
      "It's a great movie, just like Infinity War. Have you seen Infinity War?\n",
      "No. I usually watch comedy or romantic movies.\n",
      "It was fantastic. The end left you guessing though. Some people say Infinity War owes part of it's success to Black Panther.\n",
      "I will make a point of watching it soon.\n",
      "Apparently, there is a correlation in the success of Marvel movies and how spaced out they are each release. That's interesting.\n",
      "That is interesting. It was great chatting with you. Hope you have a great day.\n",
      "They tend to be more successful. Well, at least have the same success. It's been a pleasure chatting with you. Have a fine day.\n",
      "True, they build upon each other probably. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How's it going, have you seen Infinity War, the sequel to 2012 Avengers\n",
      "No, I don't really know the series very well. Is it good?\n",
      "Yea it was pretty good, it was the first film to be shot entirely with a digital imax camera\n",
      "I guess the quality must be very high. Probably looks good on BluRay too. \n",
      "Yea plus it's pretty cool they have Lou Ferrigno doing the voice of Hulk\n",
      "Lou! Great to see that he's getting work. He was awesome as the Hulk on TV>\n",
      "Yea, Lou has been doing the voice of Hulk in all the Marvel movies\n",
      "Michael Jackson tried to buy Marvel  in the early 1990's so that he could play Spider-man in his own produced movie. Would that have worked? How about his voice?\n",
      "That's crazy, interestingly Marvel tried to sell all their cinematic rights to Sony but they only wanted Spiderman\n",
      "They blew it! Hollywood needs stories. The execs never understand story. How much is that catalog worth now?\n",
      "I don't know, billions with the help of the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy\n",
      "The rights to a lot of those characters seems confusing. Disney does not own the rights to show \"big\" marvel characters  in theme parks east of the Mississippi\n",
      "Yea, all the big marvel characters have their own attractions at Universal in FL\n",
      "I guess the kids must go nuts for them. They really know how to appeal to kids. Marvel  created a superhero, Blue Ear, just for a 4 year old boy who was uncomfortable wearing hearing aids, which he needed. the boy told his mom \"superheroes don't wear hearing aids\" so marvel created one.\n",
      "That's pretty cool. Theres another superheoro named Access who is shared by both DC and Marvel\n",
      "They don't fight over him? What does he do?\n",
      "Access sole job is to keep the DC and Marvel universes separate\n",
      "I guess that could be a tough job. Superheroes trying to barge into the other universe for a better contract and more work.\n",
      "I guess so although x-men aren't considered people according to US courts\n",
      "Well, that certainly must be insulting to them. With the word \"men\" in their name, and they aren't human?\n",
      "Legally they are considered mutants allowing marvel to pay less on x-men toys\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, are you a Thor fan?\n",
      "Oh, I'm a big fan of all the Marvel films!  How about yourself?\n",
      "I like them all too but i prefer Thor myself\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought Thor Ragnarok was the best of the Thor films.  I think it might be in part because of all the improvised dialogue.  \n",
      "Yeah me too, that surely made it more realistic in nature\n",
      "Did you know Tom Hiddleston originally tried out for the part of Thor?  He even went on a strict diet and gain 50 pounds of muscle.\n",
      "wow, that sucks that he did all that just to be a side kick\n",
      "Ahhh, but he makes such a good Loki though!  It's like one of Marvel's most memorable villains!  \n",
      "yeah but i'm sure he was depressed about the change in character\n",
      "You remember that mid credits scene in the Avengers where they're all at that Shawarma restaurant?  They say that caused a noticeable increase in sales.  I find that pretty funny\n",
      "Oh yeah, i'm sure the restaurant was glad of that free advertisement!\n",
      "Like Tony, I'd never even HEARD of Shawarma before seeing that movie!  (Still haven't had a chance to try it though..)\n",
      "Yeah, its a small restaurant in LA\n",
      "I bet Sony is kicking themselves for not having bought the rights to ALL Marvel characters way back when they had the chance.  (Course, this was long before superhero films had become big business...)\n",
      "Yeah, i know i would be. You would think that they would think of the future as far as comic characters go and realize that they all would eventually be big names!\n",
      "Did yo know Marvel once created a superhero with a hearing aid just for a boy who had to wear them?\n",
      "That is awesome, I'm sure the boy wears them now\n",
      "Yeah, they called him Blue Ear, and the boy was 4 years old at the time.  \n",
      "That is so cool\n",
      "Another weird little factoid.. the guy who voices Jarvis in the Iron Man films has never actually SEEN the films.  Thought that was kind of weird..\n",
      "Yeah, that IS weird! Well, it was great chatting with you. I hope you have a great day, take care!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a fan of the Avengers?\n",
      "Not really, but I know it's a great movie franchise.\n",
      "I was turned off of the series by Ironman; I don't like Robert Downey Jr.\n",
      "They have so many characters.  I think they could substitute actors in the characters anytime they want, so don't fret about Downey.\n",
      "Who do you think will be the one who gets killed off?\n",
      "It probably doesn't matter.  They can always do prequels, or sequels that bring the character back to life.  I know so little I can't even guess.\n",
      "I don't see how you could get rid of the bigger name characters like Hulk\n",
      "I don't think that anyone is safe.  A big name could lead to a big box office.\n",
      "I agree. I do think that Thor might be the only one who could take on the Hulk\n",
      "How about Spider-Man?  But he lives in a whole different movie series for Sony.\n",
      "Yeah I don't think he is in the mix. I see THor being vulnerable too\n",
      "It's funny how the actors do the PR tour with TV personalities like Jimmy Kimmel to build the suspense, leave us guessing.\n",
      "Jimmy did a good job to try to ask the question that all fans are dying to know the answer to.\n",
      "Not coincidentally, Disney owns both the Marvel franchise and ABC's Jimmy Kimmel show.\n",
      "Makes you think then that Jimmy already knows the answer but is unwilling to reveal it to his fans.\n",
      "Yes, leave us guessing.  They definitely want the film to make an impact.  It was filmed entirely with IMAX cameras, wonder the impression it will give in an IMAX theater.\n",
      "There are no IMAX theaters in my area and I really wish there was. The closest one to me is about 5 hours away.\n",
      "Did you know that Disney cannot show many Marvel characters at Disney World, only Disneyland.  Universal owns the rights east of the Mississippi River. Strange how that works.\n",
      "Seems odd to only show your product to half of the country for sure\n",
      "There is a Hulk ride at Universal Orlando, and I think a lot of other Marvel characters are there.\n",
      "I am headed to the theater now to see what happens.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good morning. Did you watch Avengers Infinity War? Thanos was so intense!\n",
      "Good morning!  I did!  It was the first film ever to be shot entirely with digital imax cameras!\n",
      "That explains why it was so clear with great picture! Josh Brolin who played Thanos was an excellent villain, a real bad guy!\n",
      "Yes!  The voice actor who played Jarvis in the Iron Man series and the Avengers has never actually seen the films.  that's interesting!\n",
      "I wonder why? Maybe not a Marvel fan? I also am curious to know why the movie caused an increase in Shawarma sales?\n",
      "I'm not sure.  What is a shawarma? lol  The waitress Capt. America saves in the Avengers voiced Gretchen in Recess.\n",
      "Not sure who Gretchen from Recess is! But Shawarma is the mediterranean cuisine usually chicken.\n",
      "I ok! lol  I don't know who Gretchen is either!  I'm 0 for 2.  lol  Have you ever heard of the superhero called Blue Ear that Marvel comics created?\n",
      "Oh yeah! Blue ear is that superhero that was created for a 4 year old boy who didn't like wearing hearing aids. Very heartwarming!\n",
      "Nice!  Do you know there is one character owned by both Marvel and DC named Access whose sole purpose is to try to keep both companies' universes separate?\n",
      "Why is it so important to keep the worlds separate? Batman and Hulk should be able to meet someday! I thought Disney owned the rights to all Marvel characters but they don't own the rights to the \"big\" ones!\n",
      "I see that.  Is that just for the rights in the theme parks East of the Mississippi?\n",
      "Yes exactly right. It was due to a contract Marvel signed with Universal Studios in the 90's. Wonder if they will ever revisit the contract?\n",
      "I'm sure they will at some point.  Marvel successfully argues in court that mutants are not people and thus got to pay the lower rate on X-men toys instead of the higher rate for dolls because they are not human.  They must be talking about taxes.\n",
      "Yes that is a very smart idea and must have saved them a lot of money! They also once offered the Marvel cinematic rights to Sony for only 25 million!\n",
      "Sony messed up there big time!\n",
      "Agreed. They only bough spiderman for 10 million because that's all they thought people would want to watch!\n",
      "That's crazy!  I assume that you are also a Thor fan?  I'm a fan of Ant man, who made his Marvel debut before Spider Man, Hulk, Thor, and Iron Man!\n",
      "Yep I love them all! Thor is a beast and I think Chris Hemsworth portrays the God so perfectly!\n",
      "I agree with you there!  I can't believe it's been 8 years already since it came out in 2011.  I've had fun chatting with you this morning!\n",
      "Can't wait to see what the future holds for Thor and his brother Loki. Lovely chatting with you too, have a good day!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey what do you think about Justin Bieber? You think his marriage to Hailey Baldwin will last for a long time?\n",
      "I think it will last as long as Kim Kardashian and Chris Humphries's marriage.\n",
      "LOL you could be right about that. It's interesting that he posted about her on Instagram too. His love note is actually very heartfelt I think\n",
      "I give a year. What's your thoughts?\n",
      "Yeah I could see a year. Or they could be weird and actually have it last forever lol. I do like that Justin Bieber granted 200 wishes for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, that's very nice of him\n",
      "Yeah. I wonder how many of these celebrities get a terrible wrap but are actually really nice people who do a lot of MAW like stuff?\n",
      "Yep I agree. I'm curious too, it's shocking that he is the one that did the most appearances by any recording artist too. I would have never guessed that\n",
      "Yeah. I read that his \"Baby\" is the most disliked video on YouTube. Would it change anyone's mind if they knew that about him?\n",
      "I think it would change a lot of people's minds. Apparently that video is 900000 dislikes, but I actually like him or knowing that he does those Make-A-Wish Foundation visits\n",
      "He has a few songs that I like but I do not actively seek hm out. Who's your favorite artist or band?\n",
      "Well I don't like Ariana Grande. But she is very popular, I always thought she was Hispanic but she's actually Italian\n",
      "Wow, I had no idea she's italian. I too thought she was hispanic. \n",
      "Yep I agree. Funny that she has a song about female empowerment called Dangerous women, yet it was written by three men, talk about a hypocrite\n",
      "Did you recently see pics of her on a zamboni at a pathers game? She got hit by the puck, TWICE!\n",
      "That's funny! Apparently that happen when she was only 5 years old, she was also very talented as a ten-year-old, she co-founded a singing group called\"kids who care\"\n",
      "She was on Victorious and Sam and Cat? I had no idea...\n",
      "I didn't know that either. I like that she all the charity concert though, do you remember the Manchester bombing? She raised over $13 for the victims\n",
      "Was that the one that she was performing at when the bomb went off?\n",
      "Yep that's the one. Very scary in my opinion. Interesting that she was born in 1993, she's so young! Yeah\n",
      "Agreed. I watch music awards shows and I have no idea who the performers are anymore. I feel so old!\n",
      "Yep I agree with you! but do you like animals though, I love dogs myself\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you think about Justin Bieber getting engaged to Hailey Baldwin?\n",
      "Eh.  I dont follow him too much.  Im really not a fan of his.  You?\n",
      "No I like some of his songs but I don't really care if he marries this girl LOL I just thought it's interesting that he could have almost anyone he wants and yet chose her\n",
      "I  dont really know who she is either, to be honest.\n",
      "I guess they did have on again and off again romances, and finally he announced that they were engaged and that was that LOL\n",
      "I see that she is Stephen Baldwin's daughter.  As with so many hollywood relationships, I doubt it will last.\n",
      "Yep Stephen Baldwin is pretty crazy, I was wondering if she was one of the Baldwins daughters haha. Did you know that Justin Bieber was born in 1994 and is Canadian\n",
      "I knew he was Canadian, but 94...  wow thats making me feel a little old.\n",
      "Haha yep me too. It's amazing that he was the first artist to have seven songs debut in the top 100\n",
      "Wow.  He did have a very successful teeny bopper phase.  He has also granted 200 wishes for Make A Wish.  Mad props for that.\n",
      "Yeah that is a lot! It's the most given by any recording artist actually\n",
      "I think it is really important for these artists to give back, especially to kids.  As a cancer survivor things like make a wish a big deal to me.\n",
      "Yep I could see that. It's also interesting that his song baby is the most disliked on YouTube, that seems excessive there are definitely worse songs out there\n",
      "Yeah, I can think of a few for sure.\n",
      "Speaking of artists, what do you think about Ariana Grande? Apparently she was hit in the head with a puck when she was only 5 years old which would hurt\n",
      "That would hurt!  Those things fly fast.  \n",
      "Yep I'm shocked you didn't cause any significant damage, did you know that she's not actually Hispanic but rather Italian\n",
      "Really, I didnt know that.  I find it funny her song all about female empowerment was written by three men.\n",
      "LOL that is funny. At least she did a concert tour for the victims in the Manchester bombing, she raised over 13 million dollars which is really nice\n",
      "That is great.  I love seeing them give back.  Artists certainly have a huge pull.\n",
      "Yep I agree with you. What kind of animals do you like by the way? Did you know there are over twenty quintillion on Earth\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, do you like Justin Bieber?\n",
      "Hello, I'm not a big fan. Are you into his music?\n",
      "There is one song I listen to but I never seek it out. Do you have a favorite artist?\n",
      "I love Linkin Park. What about you?\n",
      "I like them too. They were huge back in the day!\n",
      "I saw the slo-mo theme in the movie Dredd was based on Justin Bieber's song.\n",
      "I had not seen that movie. Is it any good?\n",
      "I haven't seen it either. I saw Bieber granted 200 wishes to the make-a-wish foundation which is the most ever done.\n",
      "Wow, that's really nice.\n",
      "I was thinking the same thing. There's a guy in his 30's named Justin Bieber who was banned for sharing the same name with the famous Justin Bieber.\n",
      "He has never had a number one hit in the US or great britain.\n",
      "Interesting...I did not know that. I saw his Baby video is the most disliked video on YouTube.\n",
      "I feel like that song did a lot for YouTube. Do you know who Ariana Grande is?\n",
      "I do know of her. I think she's been in a lot of television roles too.\n",
      "Up until recently I had no idea who she was. She was the first fan hit by a FL panthers puck.\n",
      "Did not know that. I bet that hurt. Her song Dangerous Woman was actually written by 3 men.\n",
      "HA! I always find those tidbits funny. She had a concert that grossed $13M for the victims of the Manchester Bombing.\n",
      "Wow that's a lot of money. Do you like animals?\n",
      "I do like animals. Do you?\n",
      "I love animals. There are 20 quintillion animals on Earth. \n",
      "That's a lot of animals! It was nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi, how are you?\n",
      "I'm good.  Just wishing it would stop snowing, spring would get here, and I could go golfing sometime. How are you? \n",
      "I am the same! I just snow blowed and salted. I am in chicago and feel the same! So done with this.\n",
      "Do you golf in the Chicago area?  There are probably some neat courses there.  Although, they take up a lot of land space and require a lot of water.\n",
      "I work in parks and rec and have a first hand knowledge of golf and am terrible at it. I just want to go home to cold beer when I am done for the day. It's like work to me.\n",
      "That literally made me laugh aloud.  It's funny how recreation for some is work for another.  You probably don't play tennis either.  Personally, I'd rather run than play either sport.\n",
      "Me too but that has to do with me joining a tennis tournament growing up and getting absolutely waxed! My parents didn't even try to make me feel better. We just got ice cream and didn't bring it up.\n",
      "So you are saying you didn't have Roger Federer tendencies as a child?  I tried to play once and discovered I have zero tennis skill.  It was very humbling, and there was no ice cream, unfortunately.\n",
      "None. I am pretty sure federer could have hit me in the head with a tennis ball on his serve and I would not have known about the serve for a few minutes... \n",
      "Yeah, he is kind of talented: 20 Grand Slam titles attest to that.  But even more impressive is the fact that he has been \"gifted\" with two cows for winning tournaments throughout his career.  A cow would be so much better than a trophy.  \n",
      "The hell's he gonna do with cows? Does he own a farm? I would just look at them like, \"And????\"\n",
      "Make them pets, of course.  I'd rather have that than be honored with an official stamp, like Switzerland did for him.  Imagine having your face plastered everywhere.  That would be horrible.\n",
      "But Roger is good looking so that would be nice. If my face were on a stamp, then yes, get me cows. \n",
      "Overall, tennis players seems to be pretty fit and attractive.  Novak Djokovic isn't bad either.  Neither is Rafael Nadal.  Ah, to be that talented.\n",
      "If you ever watch nadal, look at his forearms. One is like popeye\n",
      "Interesting.  I will check that out sometime.  All three have had successful careers and longevity.  They've won like 56% of men's grand slams since 2000.  That's a pretty amazing stat.\n",
      "Yeah. In 2007, roger and raf competed on a court that was half grass and half clay.\n",
      "That would pose quite a challenge, I imagine.  I wonder who won that.  \n",
      "The fans... Raf is better on clay and rog is better on grass. It was a corporate event where they both got PAID!\n",
      "Good point.  That's what it's all about in the end, I guess. That and the prestige, and the titles, and the ATP rankings, and the cows...\n",
      "HAHAHA Cows.. Nice reference. Nice chatting with you!\n",

      "Hello, do you ever read movie reviews in Rotten Tomatoes?\n",
      "Hi, yes I do sometimes. Micahel Bay has a rating of less than 40% in there\n",
      "wow and his movies make millions. And movies based on video games have ratings lower than 50%\n",
      "Yeah I guess they are not that great. Netflix has 150 movies with 100% ratings in RT\n",
      "Wow, that is pretty impressive of them. Do you know who owns RT?\n",
      "I was actually surprised when I learned that Warner Bros does.\n",
      "Yeah pretty cool. Spykids has such a high rating in there 93%\n",
      "Yeah that is so strange, that is better than Lincoln and the dark knight rises\n",
      "That is wicked. Have you seen the Black Panther?\n",
      "I have and I totally loved it. Black Panther is the richest superhero worth $500 billion\n",
      "Wow that means he is richer than Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne, they are worth a lot too\n",
      "Yeah that is true. Did you watch the Academy Awards?\n",
      "I did not this year but I know that Daniel Day Lewis has won three of them for best actor.\n",
      "He is a talented actor so that makes sense. Blazing Saddles was also nominated for 3 of them\n",
      "Nice. Walt Disney though holds the record with 22 of them\n",
      "Wow that raises the bar high for everyone. Even Eminem has won Oscars and more than Leo di Caprio\n",
      "Yeah that is pretty cool of him. Surpassed others such Johnny Depp and George Lucas too\n",
      "Yeah , what a talent. Oscar were nominated for 9 Emmys. Wonder how that works\n",
      "Yeah I am confused too about that. Do you know how many Oscars are given out?\n",
      "Yes there are 24 awards given over a range of categories\n",
      "That is quite a few of them. Nice chat\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "I'm well, and you?\n",
      "Very well, thanks. What stood out to you in your article?\n",
      "The rankings on Rotten Tomatoes being used as a reliable source\n",
      "HA! Is that like students using Wikipedia as a knowledge source to you?\n",
      "very much so. One of the students in my grad school class used it one time. You'd figure by then you would know\n",
      "HA... That's funny. Grad school? I teach undergrad and made a point to say wiki is not an ok source.\n",
      "kids don't try anymore, just pick up the first result and hope for the best\n",
      "I see that. I do have about 12 students that just shine. I cannot wait to see what they do in their career. They are really good.\n",
      "what do you teach?\n",
      "I teach sport management. You?\n",
      "I'm actually not a teacher I'm a manager for refrigeration repair service company. However, I went to Towson University for undergrad and got my bachelor's in sports management. Any idea how I can get a job? ha\n",
      "Get ready to start at the bottom. What do you want to do?\n",
      "Yea I figured that but my mindset (while true I am probably overstating it) is you have to know somebody to get in. And I'm fine at the bottom but going unpaid would be very difficult for me financially. I have my masters in Data Analysis so something in the sports and data side would be perfect, although I am not particularly picky\n",
      "Have you thought about working for like Stats Inc? There is such a need for statisticians in today's sports.\n",
      "I have not looked into that avenue specifically, but I will definitely check it out.\n",
      "Yeah, I see more and more teams even starting their own analytics department to look for value in the numbers. Billy Bean started a revolution and it's not slowing down.\n",
      "It really is astonishing the route he took and how quickly it blew up. I am an Orioles fan and they had zero analytics prior to this offseason and it obviously shows.\n",
      "HAHA. Poor Buck... That old school mentality no longer works.\n",
      "He really pulled a rabbit out of his hat to make the team competitive for the time they were, but it was destined to blow up sooner than later.\n",
      "Good luck with the job search!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you doing this evening?\n",
      "I'm doing well. Do you ever watch or play tennis or golf?\n",
      "I'm not really into either sport. Golf is too slow and tennis, well, I just don't understand it. You?\n",
      "I agree about golf. I don't play tennis enough to really know how, but it is interesting. I wonder if it would be easier to learning with singles or doubles\n",
      "I figure with singles, I would learn from my mistakes faster. The equipment was too expensive for me as a kid, plus there were no courts around.\n",
      "Same for me growing up. Now I live in an area that has a lot of courts. I can't imagine playing a match that lasts 11 hours though, even if it's spread over three days\n",
      "I guess they both wanted that bonus! 11 hours, though. Did anybody watch the entire thing? \n",
      "I'm not sure, but there would have had to have been as least a referee or someone else, right? I wonder if they wore polo shirts since they were created for tennis players\n",
      "Those shirts seem comfortable but a bit too stylish for serious athletes. I guess it's important to be stylin' while bashing a ball.\n",
      "They might be have practicality to them too for sports like tennis and polo. I guess polo shirt is a little more catchy than tennis shirt would be\n",
      "The tennis world seems to skew to the high end. They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US Open. That's the solution I would have come up with too. LOL\n",
      "That's actually a genius solution though. Maybe that's why most courts now aren't on grass. At the US Open the year before that, a black man won the title, and that's the only year a black man has won\n",
      "The sport favors the rich. To get to that level, you need equipment, courts, and most of all, coaching. Black kids in the US just don't have access. The Williams sisters seem the exception.\n",
      "They seem to have a natural talent for it as well. What are the chances that two sisters would both be good at it. Have you ever heard of Gael Monfils?\n",
      "I think their dad pushed them I don't know if he was athletic.  Haven't heard of Gael. Who is that?\n",
      "He was a quarterfinalist in the US Open who only days after learning how to play, beat the \"Roger Federer of paddle tennis.\" Natural talent\n",
      "Some people just do it without thinking. I wish I had that kind of talent. Why was Roger Federer  gifted two cows over his career for winning the 2003 wimbledon and the 2013 Swiss Open?\n",
      "Good meat can be expensive. Maybe it was to help him up his protein intake. That's a lot of steaks and burgers\n",
      "Perhaps he sells the milk as a special Federer line. \n",
      "Maybe. The Swiss also honored him with an official stamp. He's the only person to have been given that as well\n",
      "That's a great honor. Well, I enjoyed chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello. Do you like movies?\n",
      "I do, I have a few good ones aligned for the weekend, what about you?\n",
      "I do. I like some that are probably on the Rotton Tomatoes list. Did you know that Warner Brothers owns Rotton Tomatoes\n",
      "No I didnt know that, I wonder if they are biased towards WB movies\n",
      "Me too. What is interesting is no video game film has rated above 44%\n",
      "I guess video games are fine as is, Netflix has a great selecion of movies 150 of them have a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes\n",
      "And they also have Dark Knight rises on there. I guess they don't like a lot of movies.\n",
      "I love that movie, did it get a good rating?\n",
      "No it got a bad one. Rotton Tomatoes is for bad movies. Michael Bays rating is 38% . I guess that's not too bad.\n",
      "I think thats an unfari rating, did you watch Black Panther?\n",
      "I did. It was a good movie. Chadwick Boseman was good in it.\n",
      "He is a great actor, he really sold the part, the director of the film also did a good job\n",
      "Yes and Black Panther had a great net worth over 500 billion \n",
      "He must be like the richest hero right? he owns a country, that must be good on financials lol\n",
      "I don't think any other superhero comes close.\n",
      "Bruce Wayne has a net worth of $80 billion and he is insanely rich\n",
      "That is true. Do you watch award shows? Did you know Daniel Day Lewis is the only actor to win an oscar 3 times. That's great.\n",
      "No I didnt know that, he is a really talented actor though,  there are 24 categories in the oscars right?\n",
      "Yes, and Walt Disney has won over 22. That is crazy.\n",
      "That is crazy but not suprising either, Walt Disney changed our culture forever so he deserves an award ot twenty \n",
      "Yes, he was great.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a golf fan? There apparently is a course in Dubia that requires 4M gallons of water a day to keep it green. Seems like a waste to me. \n",
      "I do like golf and yes it does seem like a waste.  The average American golf course consumes around 312,000 gallons of water per day as well.\n",
      "Wow. Wonder how many golf courses there are? I heard they take up more land space than Rhode Island and Delaware combined. \n",
      "That's a pretty incredible amount when you think about it.  Samuel Jackson puts a golf clause in his film contracts that allows him to play golf twice a week during production.\n",
      "Nice. Love him. Babe Ruth was once the most famous golfer in America. Assuming it was the same time he was the most famous baseball player too. \n",
      "Who would have guessed that?  I didn't know he was a big golf player.\n",
      "Me neither. How about tennis? I'm not a huge fan. Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis before they caught on with the polo crowd. \n",
      "That's an interesting fact. They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 open.  Bet that created a lot of wind.\n",
      "That's crazy! The longest match in history was 11 hours and went on for 3 days. I remember watching one a few years ago that went several hours, but 11! They must have had rubber legs after that one. \n",
      "No doubt!  I wonder if at any point either player thought \"this just isn't worth it\".   There must have been big money on the line.\n",
      "Haha. Good question. Or maybe they were playing for cows, like the ones Roger Federer was gifted for winning Wimbledon and the Swiss Open. \n",
      "What?  LOL  He is the first living person in Switzerland to be honored with a stamp.  How neat!\n",
      "He also suffered the biggest injury of his career -- while drawing a bath for his daughters. \n",
      "That must have been when he tore his meniscus?\n",
      "Yeah, I think so. I bet his was pissed!\n",
      "I bet.  That would have put a dent in his earnings for sure.  Since the year 2000, Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic have accounted for 56 percent of the mens grand slam singles titles.\n",
      "Wow. Nadal and Federer once competed on a hybrid court that was half clay and half grass. I wonder how that worked?\n",
      "That would be interesting to see.  I wonder if that's on youtube?  Federer has been continuously ranked in the top 10 from Oct. 2002 to Nov. 2016.  What a run.\n",
      "Definitely. He is one of the all time greats, for sure. He's held the #1 spot in the rankings for more than 310 weeks... a record. \n",
      "I wonder who the \"Roger Federer of paddle tennis\" is?  A guy named Gail Monfils beat him to get into the US open quarterfinals after learning how to play just 2 days earlier.\n",
      "No idea. I'll have to look that up. Been great chatting with you!\n",
      "I've enjoyed chatting with you as well!  Have a good day!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, are you a golf fan?\n",
      "Hi yes I like gold somewhat I think what drew me to like this sport was from Tiger Woods who is a great global golfer.\n",
      "Yeah, he went from dominant, to a non factor, and now seems to be coming back again.  He is fighting back into contention.\n",
      "He really did become a non factor after that big scandal. He is trying to make a comeback but he seems to be having a rough start .\n",
      "In a recent tournament he started the final round of 72 in contention, but not as dominant as in the past.\n",
      "Oh wow I din't know that so I can agree not as good as past tournaments but a great start especially being that  he was away for some time he did state in a interview that he is fighting hard for his scores so he is still putting his all in. I love tennis also how about you?\n",
      "Not so much, do find it interesting that Polo shirts were once invented for tennis players.\n",
      "I love it it's so great to watch them compete with just a racket and a hollow rubber ball it's just an intense competition to me, and Polo has great clothing it is weird that they was inspired from tennis players. \n",
      "I can watch tennis occasionally, but was more interested prior to 2000.  Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic seemingly win all the time.\n",
      "Roger Federer is a great player he is  number 3 in the world for ranking but you know he had a huge injury in 2016 I wonder did he ever recover and return to playing. \n",
      "Not sure.  Did you know he was the first living person in Switzerland to be honored with a stamp?\n",
      "No I actually didn't that was probably a proud moment to be recognized and supported by your own country he is a legend if you as me though so I can see why I mean the man won 20 Grand Slam titles he is a beast. \n",
      "For sure.  I didn't realize he had the most singles victories in Grand Slam history.\n",
      "He has many but I mean he has been playing professional since 1998 and was ranked in the top starting in 2002. Who do you feel is better Roger or Tiger even though they play 2 different sports? \n",
      "Probably Tiger.  Both are great, but Tiger has drawn people to watch golf that aren't even golf fans.  Don't think I can say the same for Federer.\n",
      "I can agree I never looked at it or thought into it that way and I wold also have to say that Tiger Woods has also drawn men into joining country club more to play and enjoy the game.\n",
      "I would agree with that. Normally when a athlete goes bad they're about done.  But with Woods sorting out his swing it might give others some hope.\n",
      "I just really hope he gets his swing back which I know he will because he has so many years into this sport I know he won't give up that easy and he also realizes his mistakes in his swing.\n",
      "Yup, I agree.  Well, it's been pleasant chatting with you.\n",
      "It has been such a pleasure as well we both need to keep up with the status on our old favorite professional golfer Tiger Woods. \n",
      "for sure.  take care.\n",
      "Thanks same to you\n",
      "\n",

      "Did you know that all 50 states have dinosaur fossil in them?\n",
      "I never thought about it really, but it doesn't seem surprising. \n",
      "Did you see Jurassic world fallen kingdom?\n",
      "Yeah I did, it was a little cheesy but I loved the graphics effects. Did you see it?\n",
      "\n",
      "I did. I always like the originals better but im happy for the lead actor. \n",
      "Me too, the originals are classic. I do enjoy Chris Pratt too though. It's funny that Pratt joked about the lead role so long ago.\n",
      "Wow did you hear that the ride cost 110 million while the film cost only 63 million.\n",
      "You know, I actually did hear that once waiting in lint to go on the ride. Have you ever been on the ride?\n",
      "No that's past my time i got to stay in my lane. I hear it took 6 hours to render one frame of the rain soaked T-rex.\n",
      "Yeah I can't believe that. Honestly it's such an iconic scene though, it was definitely worth it.\n",
      "Well the raptors weren't generated by computers but had real ppl inside.\n",
      "That surprises me, I think in the first movies they were effects. Can you believe dinosaurs were mesotherms? \n",
      "Well there are 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth.\n",
      "I never believed that was a real number. I think it's really cool that the loch ness monster is a protected species, though.\n",
      "Yeah they did that back in 1912, right? Under Scottish protections.\n",
      "That's right, really makes me wonder. I hear that domestication gives animal white forehead patches. Seems unlikely, though.\n",
      "Yeah well Germany was the first country to give animals universally constitutionally-guaranteed rights\n",
      "That seems very progressive of them. Do you know what a blastula is?\n",
      "No but it sounds like an interesting word.\n",
      "Right? It's fun to say. I know it from my biology classes.\n",
      "1.5 M living animals species have been described and 1 M are insects. nice talking with you.\n",
      "And there's over 7 million species that we know of. Nice to talk to you as well.\n",

      "Hi, do you like Batman?\n",
      "I do like Batman. He is a tragic and mysterious superhero. You?\n",
      "I love him too. In the 90's, Universal Studios had plans to build a Gotham City theme park.\n",
      "I wonder how many people would have gone. It's not a bad idea, but probably too expensive.\n",
      "I bet it would have been very expensive to build. I would have had to check it out at least once.\n",
      "True. Batman fans would love the place. Smallville was originally planned to be a show about Bruce Wayne becoming Batman. A much darker show, then.\n",
      "Oh wow I didn't know that. I saw that Michael Keaton was so against Batman Forever that even $15 million couldn't sway him to reprise the role.\n",
      "I guess it is not a rewarding role. That's a lot of money for Michael Keaton, too.\n",
      "I bet. Stan Lee wrote 15 DC comics which I was unaware of.\n",
      "Neither did I. I guess he wanted to give the DC superheroes a different look.\n",
      "I guess so. Do you read any comic books?\n",
      "I read some when I was young. Not so much now. How about you?\n",
      "Not too much. I saw that Stan Lee ends every phone conversation with the word \"excelsior\".\n",
      "I guess everybody has their quirks. I wonder what he meant by that.\n",
      "Not too sure. Stinks that he recently passed away.\n",
      "He lived a long life, longer than most. The Michigan State University library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world. I bet Stan has many books in there.\n",
      "He did live a very long life. I didn't know that about Michigan. Very cool.\n",
      "There are over 300 registered superheroes in the US. I wonder how many of them Stan created.\n",
      "That's pretty cool. I bet he created quite a few of those.\n",
      "I agree. He probably didn't create this one:  a superhero called \"normalman,\"  the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes.\n",
      "It was good talking to you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you happen to watch Batman the animated series in the 90s?\n",
      "i did a little bit, but was never familiar with who Bruce Timm was.  I never read comic book series though either.\n",
      "Me neither, though I did watch the show alot when I Was a kid. I remember batmans glowing eyes.\n",
      "funny how DC comics really had no other competition too.\n",
      "yea, especially now with Marvel making better movies.\n",
      "I never made the connection between Batman and the Suicide Squad movie.  makes sense now though.\n",
      "I've not seen Suicide Squads. Whats the connection?\n",
      "I guess Batman the Animated Series creator Bruce Timm produced Batman and Harley Quinn.  I guess Margot Robbie made Harley Quinn popular in Suicide Squad.  though I think Margot Robbie could make anyone more popular!  \n",
      "Worked well in Wolf of Wall Street! \n",
      "uh huh!  she's amazing.  I liked the Batman movie with Michael Keaton back in 1989.  but he would not do Batman forever for $15M!\n",
      "Would help if the first one weren't terrible. That's even more money back then!\n",
      "yeah, and Smallville was originally going to be a show about Bruce Wayne becoming Batman.  i never watched that show but it looked pretty cool.  so many shows movies and comics about Batman i never knew.\n",
      "They offer lots of origin stories now, like man of steel for superman. I haven't watched many of them.\n",
      " I think these creative genius types like Stan Lee of Marvel Comics can be a bit eccentric. He ends every phone conversation with the word \"excelsior!\"\"\n",
      "Hah yes. RIP Mr. Lee.\n",
      "The DC from DC comics stands for detective comics.  sounds redundant.\n",
      "Really? I had no idea.\n",
      "me neither.  Michigan State U has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world too.\n",
      "They are a pretty large university. Not real surprising\n",
      "here's something interesting.  there was a superhero call \"Normalman\" who has no super powers.  not sure how he was super...\n",
      "I guess the eay answer is hes not\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, do you like animals?\n",
      "Yes, I do. Even \"Animal\" from the Muppets! Do you like animals?\n",
      "I love animals. DO you know how many individual animals are predicted to exist today?\n",
      "No, I don't. I've heard that construction over a dried up lake for an on ramp had to stop because they found more unknown biological creatures than ever before, though.\n",
      "Yeah I guess we are always exploring new species. There are about 20 quintillion ones\n",
      "That's a lot! That lake they had to stop construction over was thought to never stop slowly sinking because of all the biological matter there. Speaking of that, do you remember the dino poo scene in the first Jurassic Park?\n",
      "No I do not remember that but I know that the dinosaurs only appeared in it for 15 minutes\n",
      "I realized that when I was trying to show dino from that movie to my son! I guess dino poo has been a really important part of how we've learned about them.\n",
      "Ohh interesting one. Did you know the ride cost more than the movie?\n",
      "I did not know that. I also didn't realize that Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom was out for like a year.\n",
      "Yeah it has been for a while. Do you know how they generated the raptors in the movie?\n",
      "I think I work too much. I only knew Jurassic World was out and saw it. Did they use computers? Or ostriches? lol\n",
      "Actually they used people in suits for those, must have been cheaper\n",
      "So funny! I heard when then did use computers in the movie it took hours for one frame to render for a t rex dinosaur!\n",
      "That is amazing. Chris Pratt joked about getting the lead and actually got it years later\n",
      "I heard that! I also heard they have a dung smearing scene that's been left out of those dinosaur movies. I can't say it was a mistake...\n",
      "Yup exactly. Did you know all 50 states have a dinosaur or fossil?\n",
      "Well, I remember they do have the dinosaur poo scene in the first movie. That was enough. They say we can learn more from the poo than the bones, though.\n",
      "It might tell us more about them I guess. Did you know dinosaurs were mesothermic?\n",
      "No, I can never remember the period names. I lived dinosaurs as a kid, too. I remember learning dimetrodons are not dinosaurs but lizards.\n",
      "That is pretty cool. In Canada they have a glow-in-the-dark dinosaur coin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "Good! How are you? Are you a Batman fan? Back in the 90's, Universal had plans to build a Batman theme park. That would have been cool. \n",
      "I'm good, thanks for asking.  Yes, I'm a Batman fan and think that theme park would have been cool!\n",
      "What's your favorite Batman movie? Mine's The Dark Knight. I heard Smallville was originally going to be about Bruce Wayne becoming Batman. I guess that ended up as Gotham though. \n",
      "Dark Knight also.  I think Christian Bale is my favorite Batman.  Who's your favorite?\n",
      "Yeah, he's definitely my favorite. My least favorite was probably Val Kilmer. Or Clooney. Michael Keaton was so against Batman Forever that a huge payday couldn't convince him to reprise the role. \n",
      "Wow, I would have taken the money and did that movie, anyway!  But, that's just me lol Do you like Comic books?\n",
      "Yes, love comic books. Someday I'd like to checkout the comic book collection at Michigan State. It's the largest public collection in the world. \n",
      "That's amazing, I didn't know that.  Stan Lee would be proud!\n",
      "Haha. Yes, he would. Did you know the DC in DC Comics stands for Detective Comics? So their name is Detective Comics Comics. \n",
      "Funny, I always thought it stood for D.C. as in Washington D.C.  Nice to know what it stands for, finally. Thanks!\n",
      "Stan Lee used to end every phone conversation by saying \"Excelsior!\" What a character he was.\n",
      "Yes, he was!  Great guy, I always looked for his cameo shots in his movies.He was famous for that.  I think Stephen King does the same thing.\n",
      "I know Stan Lee is in more Marvel films than any other actor. Back in the day, Marvel published a generic comic book so they could trademark the names Super Hero and Super Villain. \n",
      "That was super smart of them to do that! Have you ever heard of normalman?\n",
      "I have not. What's Normalman?\n",
      "Apparently, he's the only person on a planet without superpowers and everybody else is superheroes. Kind of an odd one?\n",
      "Haha. I like that idea! That would make a great comedy setup. The Marvel comic universe take place in a multiverse set on Earth in 199999. \n",
      "That's interesting, I wonder if all the pollution on Earth contributed to all these superheroes superpowers that far in the future?\n",
      "I wouldn't doubt it. There was a comic series about fixing all the damage created by super heroes during their adventures. Nothing about pollution though. \n",
      "Cool beans!  It's been nice chatting with you this morning.  I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.\n",
      "you too!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello,  how are u?  Are you a batman fan?  In the '90s universal studios had plans to build gotham city, a batman theme park!\n",
      "I like batman.  I've watched all the movies.  I can't believe Michael Keaton didn't want to do the movie for all that money.  I would have loved to see Gotham city at universal studios.  \n",
      "Gotham City wouldve been amazing,  still would be,  not sure why universal wouldnt go through with these plans.  Smallville was originally planned to be a show about bruce wayne becoming batman\n",
      "I tried watching Smallville but never got into it.  Maybe I would have if Bruce Wayne was in the show.  I don't understand how russian TV was able to put ninja turtles with batman lol.  \n",
      "haha right.  Never got into smallville either,  but I dont think we are missing anything.  someone told me its 10 seasons and at the very end he finally puts on the cape.  lol\n",
      "Wow!  Yeah 10 seasons that's a lot.  Reading about Stan Lee is interesting.  The fact that he ends every phone call with word \"excelsior\" is funny. \n",
      "Thats amazing!!  They should simulate a conversation with him so everyone can get a chance to have stan lee end the convo like that!  The dc from dc comics stands for detective comics, so their company name is redundant.\n",
      "I wonder how many true DC fans travel to the Michigan State Univesity to see the largest comic books collection in the world. \n",
      "probably everyone that goes to Comicon!  lol did you know There are over 300 registered superheroes in the united states.  How do you even register to be a superhero?\n",
      "I have no idea how someone would go about doing that.  I think its comical that there is a superhero called normal man.  He\n",
      "yes!  haha that makes no sense though,  he has no super powers!  so is he really a superhero.\n",
      "Maybe just a superhero among only superheroes.  Going back to Stan Lee what a great imagination he had to have created batman and superman. \n",
      "Yes,  so imaginative.  So sad he passed away.  Im sure he had an amazing life. \n",
      "Yes.  His legacy will live forever.  Batman has been around for many years and I don't see it stopping anytime soon.  There was even a batman vs. jack the ripper.  Batman vs. someone; the possibilities are endless.  \n",
      "Yeah.  Not to mention Marvel.\n",
      "What do you enjoy more TV series or movies about superheroes?  I have been wanting to watch Gotham. \n",
      "With the marvel,  i love the movies!  I have been catching up on Gotham cuz I took a break from it,  its really good.  A lot of back story.  I really like the flash series too!  \n",
      "As a kid did you ever watch the batman and robbin series?   I think it was made in the 60's or70's.\n",
      "I watched the cartoon series a lot.  The one with real people I only caught a few times.  They were both awesome!  I liked the cartoon one better though. \n",
      "I didn't know that the largest comic book market is Japan.  I thought they just did Anime tv shows but I didn't know they liked comics so much\n",
      "Me either.  Its been great talking with you.  Have a good one. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello are you a big shoe fan?  Do you like to collect different styles?\n",
      "Yes, I can't help it!  It seems I have a shoe for every mood. lol\n",
      "lol  Did you know that professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week?\n",
      "You know, I had heard that and I just couldn't believe it.  They must really be doing alot of dancing in a week to wear out 4 pair?\n",
      "I bet!  If you have smelly shoes, you can put dry tea bags in them and the tea bags will absorb the bad odor.  I'm going to have to try that! LOL  just kidding\n",
      "Me too!  My shoes I wear for spin class have taken on a foul odor, that I can't seem to get rid of, I'll try that teabag trick and see if it helps!\n",
      "Nice! lol  NFL wide receiver Steve Smith leaves his cleats on the field after every game to raise awareness for homeless people without shoes.  That's awesome he does that!\n",
      "Yes, it is very good of him to do that!  Do you own any pairs of boots?\n",
      "I do!  I don't have any Ugg's though.  They were invented by surfers to keep their feet warm.\n",
      "Wow, didn't know that!  I read that the Nokia company used to make rubber boots in the 1800's and apparently they still do.\n",
      "Wow.  That's a long time.  I didn't know that.  In 1838 a man stopped to get his boots cleaned in Paris and because he and the cleaner stood still for at least 7 minutes they bacame the first people in history to be photographed!\n",
      "That's so interesting and I bet they didn't even know they had gotten their picture taken!  \n",
      "I bet not.  I would like to see the picture.  Do you follow the US congress at all?\n",
      "Yes, I'm sorry to say I do.  It's been so divisive as of late, though.  Do you follow it?\n",
      "Not much.  The bickering really turns me off.  In 1916 the first woman was elected to congress!\n",
      "I know what you mean, there should be less bickering and alot more cooperation going on.  I didn't realize a woman was elected in 1916?  Did she even have the right to vote, at that time?\n",
      "No.  She couldn't even vote in a national election!   Elmo is the only non-human to testify before congress.  That's kind of odd.\n",
      "Yes, it is very odd! I read today that a fantasy congress exists.  Have you heard of that game?\n",
      "I've never heard of that.  What is it?\n",
      "Well, apparently the players can draft congress members and you gather points based on the success of your legislative actions.\n",
      "Interesting!  I have to run. It was nice chatting with you.  Have a great evening!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello! Did you know professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of shoes in a week?\n",
      "That is a lot of shoes and money too. There are 17 ways to tie your shoes too\n",
      "And I only know one way! 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes. Go figure.\n",
      "Yeah exactly. Bill Nye is the guy that holds the patent to the pointe ballet shoes\n",
      "Really? That's pretty crazy! Uggs were originally made for surfers, now they are everywhere!\n",
      "Nice did not know that. THere are shoes inspired by the wizard of oz that take you home as they have a gps installed in them?\n",
      "Lol, the things people will buy. I wonder if you check them on an app or something.\n",
      "I know right? The Queen of England has people that wear her shoes before she wears them to make sure they are comfy enough\n",
      "That's funny. I wonder who is wearing the queens shoes around. I also heard she only uses one shade of nailpolish and it's something you can just buy at a drug store.\n",
      "Wow I guess she is very peculiar. Did you know know persians were the first to wear high heeled shoes?\n",
      "Well, they sure started a trend! A shoe cleaner was accidentally the first person to be photographed in the world!\n",
      "WOw cool. DO you have a favorite kind of shoe. I really like comfy boots for the winter\n",
      "I like some sandals in the summer! It's the next best thing to being barefoot!\n",
      "Nice, yes it sure is. DId you know Prince played bowling and wore knee high boots when he played?\n",
      "Sounds like something he might do. Stephon Marbury promoted a line of shoes that retailed 15$ and was not paid to endorse them.\n",
      "That is odd. A guy once stole coins from a wine by taking and placing them on his boots\n",
      "Interesting! There are three subway lines exclusively for congressmen to move from the capitol and senate offices!\n",
      "Wow I guess they need to be separate. Did you know that the COngress and the President can declare someone an honorary citizen?\n",
      "I think that happened recently, an immigrant climbed a wall to save a child. I could be wrong, but either way it's a pretty cool concept.\n",
      "Yes I think that was in France or something. In the US only 7 people have won it so far\n",
      "That's pretty cool, I wonder what they did to earn it! Maybe i'll have to look that up later! Anyways, it's been a great chat!\n",
      "Same here, have a great one\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you know elmo testified before congress?\n",
      "No, I didn't. Who is elmo by the way? \n",
      "elmo is a character on sesame street\n",
      "Interesting. No I didn't know, what did he testify about? \n",
      "\n",
      "I am not sure. I guess it may have been a light hearted joke before real proceedings. \n",
      "Awesome, apparently there are fantasy congresses, I bet that is real boring stuff. \n",
      "Can you actually win money with that?\n",
      "I don't know. But they also play a republican vs democrat baseball game. It's probably not that interesting. \n",
      "Did you know Ugg boots were invented by surfers? who knew?\n",
      "No, weird. I would have thought they were invented by skiers, would you agree? \n",
      "I would agree. seems kind of silly. Or at least some typical college girl\n",
      "Well they probably last longer than a professional ballet dancer's shoes, they can go through 4 pairs of shoes a week!\n",
      "And their feet look all weird for some reason\n",
      "Well putting dry tea bags in smelly shoes will absorb the odor. \n",
      "That is something I have to try tonight\n",
      "LOL, me too. I didn't know Nokia used to make rubber boots. \n",
      "I wonder why they decided to switch over to phones\n",
      "Probably more profitable. It was in the 1800s though as well. \n",
      "Thats a good thought\n",
      "Yeah, that was pre WW1 and WW2....\n",
      "Hopefully we dont get to ww3\n",
      "That won't happen. The phrase pulling oneself up from their bootstraps meant doing the impossible. \n",
      "cool info\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "do you like star wars?\n",
      "I love it. Do you know when the whole franchise thing began?\n",
      "Yes that was back in 1977 so it has been a few years now\n",
      "Yeah true. Do you know where Oscar Isaac who plays Poe Dameron is from ?\n",
      "Yes he is from Guatemala where the scene for planet Yavin 4 were filmed\n",
      "Yes and that is why he requested that Poe be a native of that planet\n",
      "Yeah. Did you know that Lucas's wife won an Oscar for film editing?\n",
      "Yes she was the one that insterted a lot of the awesome scenes like Lei's good luck kiss\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah so pretty much she deserved it, but he has never won it I think\n",
      "Yeah. Did you know 20th century fox was convicned that the movie would flop?\n",
      "Yes so much that they let Lucas keep the rights to the movie for half a million dollars\n",
      "Yes and that is how he became a billionaire so quickly from the movie\n",
      "Yeah. Do you like Disney Company?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes I do. DO you know what Minnie Mouse's real name is?\n",
      "Yes her name is Minerva but I like Minnie better\n",
      "Me too. They consulted Bill Nye when the made the movie the Flubber\n",
      "Nice the Science Guy is so cool. Do you know what the movie wall-e is a tribute to ?\n",
      "It was a tribute to Walter Elias Disney\n",
      "Yeah/ There is a culture where they hide things Mickey in Disney things for people to find\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice it sounds like a really fun hunt for Mickey items\n",
      "That is pretty cool. Nice chat\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello,  do you watch star wars?\n",
      "Hey there I do like Star Wars. I've seen all the movies, what about you? I really like the first one the best though.\n",
      "Yes,  I have seen all of the star wars series too!\n",
      "Which movie is your favorite? It's funny that Star Wars was thought to be a flop, and so 20th Century Fox gave the merchandising rights to George Lucas, then he became a billionaire due to that LOL\n",
      "I loved the first 3 released,  but the whole series is really good,  I love these ones that have been coming out around christmas every year,  a lot of back story in those,  really good. \n",
      "Yep the backstory is interesting. You ever heard of the director James Cameron? He directed movies like Terminator in True Lies, anyway he was apparently a truck driver and was inspired by Star Wars and quit his job soon after to pursue directing\n",
      "Thats awesome,  hes really good at it,  all great movies!!!\n",
      "I agree with you! Did you hear that ewan McGregor has a brother in the British Air Force? Since ewan McGregor plays Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Star Wars movies, Colin McGregor, his brother, goes by Obi two as his calming LOL\n",
      "Hahaha thats amazing,  I didnt know that. \n",
      "Do you know who artoo-detoo is by the way? George Lucas says that the entire Star Wars saga is told by him about one hundred years in the future, that's really crazy that changes my entire perspective of the movies LOL\n",
      "I did hear that before!!  R2d2 is my favorite lol I think its really cool that Lucas' wife at the time won academy award for editing !\n",
      "I agree with you! She was really talented, and very underrated when it comes to Star Wars appreciation. Do you like the Walt Disney Company by the way? Are you glad that they bought the Star Wars franchise\n",
      "Absolutely,  I was just a disneyland 2 months ago lol From the tower of terror I could see where they are building the star wars land \n",
      "Wow that's cool! I need to go after it's completely built, have you seen the short film Destino? It was created as a collaboration between Disney and Salvador Dali, I love Salvador Dali\n",
      "No I never seen that either lol Is it any good?  Do you watch Game of Thrones?\n",
      "I do like Game of Thrones. It's one of my favorite series has and I can't wait until it starts up again. Who is your favorite character?\n",
      "Same!  I love Tyrion Lannister, Daenarys targaryn and Arya( but she is becoming a little dark) lol\n",
      "I love Tywin Lannister actually LOL I think Daenerys is kind of boring personally but that's just me, I also like the little finger but he's dead now LOL\n",
      "Ok Tywin lannister was pretty cool,  but ugh I really dislike little finger!  Daenarys does have a boring personality and shes getting a little big headed,  she doesnt even do much, but she has dragons!  \n",
      "She does have dragons, she's just indestructible which I find kind of silly haha. But I know that's just me. It's interesting that the person that plays the mountain is only 25 years old! He definitely looks a lot older\n",
      "I know right,  thats crazy.  Its been great chatting with you.  Have a good one. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi do you wear jeans a lot?\n",
      "Yes they are my favorite thing to wear actually. And you?\n",
      "Me too. Did you know Cans, North Face and a bunch of other are owned by the same company?\n",
      "Hmm did not know that, interesting. Did you know Old Navy markets jeans with 41\" waist  as 36\"?\n",
      "I wonder why though, interesting. DO you know what the tiny pocket is there for?\n",
      "Hmm not sure. I know that blue jeans are ilegal in North Korea?\n",
      "Hmm good questions, I am not sure actually, why is that?\n",
      "It is because they are seen as a sign of american imperialism\n",
      "Oh wow, I knew they were strict on a lot of things but this. Oh and the tiny pocket is for pocket watches\n",
      "Oh that is so cool, I would have never guessed that. I guess they were invented when those watches were around\n",
      "Exactly. Skinny jeans can cause damages to the nervous system though\n",
      "That is pretty scary. It makes sense though because there is so much pressure.\n",
      "Yeah exactly. How about shoes, do you have a favorite kind?\n",
      "I love runners because they are comfortable, and you?\n",
      "Me too. Did you know you can keep the fresh by putting some tea bags in them?\n",
      "That is a good trick actually. There are 17 ways you can tie your shoes\n",
      "WOw, I guess I only know 2. 5000 year old shoes hold much better than new ones nowadays\n",
      "Maybe companies need to crack that secret and made good shoes now too. Bill Nye holds the patent for ballet pointe shoes.\n",
      "Wel I guess he is the science guy after all. Ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of shoes a week\n",
      "That is crazy and it must also cost a lot to them. Queen Elizabeth II has people who try the shoes on for comfort before she wears them\n",
      "WHat a Queen, literally,, Nice chat\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, do you wear jeans?\n",
      "Hey yes I love wearing jeans. The small pocket in the larger pocket of the jeans was designed for storing pocket watches.\n",
      "Me too. I didn't know that was made for storing watches.\n",
      "Yeah it must be an old school function that just stayed around because pocket Watches really aren't that popular anymore. People have to be careful wearing skinny jeans because they cause nerve damage.\n",
      "That's crazy. Vans, North Face, Nautica, Jansport, Timberland, Lee, and Wrangler are all owned by the same company.\n",
      "Oh wow I didn't know that. Old Navy marketing with a 41 inch waist is 36 inch waist. I find that kind of odd.\n",
      "I find that odd too. Levi made Bing Cosby a denim tuxedo after he was turned away from a hotel for wearing jeans.\n",
      "That's hilarious. It is crazy to think that jeans were invented back in 1871.\n",
      "I agree. Do you like shoes?\n",
      "Yes I love you. However they are getting too expensive these days. Stephan Marbury promoted a line that retailed at $15 once.\n",
      "They are very expensive. Did you know 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes?\n",
      "Ha ha that is hard to believe. I wonder what those shoes were made from. One good trick is to put dry teabag and smelly shoes to absorb the unpleasant  odor.\n",
      "That's a very good trick. I'll have to try that out sometime.\n",
      "Some people can't afford shoes but NFL wide receiver Steve Mitch leave his cleats on the field after every game to raise awareness to homeless people without shoes.\n",
      "That's pretty amazing of him. Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of ballet shoes per week.\n",
      "Wow that is amazing. They are definitely not like the shoes 5 thousand years ago..\n",
      "I agree. Did you know Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis players?\n",
      "Oh that is odd I always thought they were invented by polo player. I wonder how they got the name polo shirt?\n",
      "I'm not sure how they got the name. Do you?\n",
      "No idea. But the tennis player who made the polo shirt famous was nicknamed the crocodile.\n",
      "It was good chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hey there my friend have you ever seen star wars?\n",
      "Have I ever seen Star Wars?!!! of course, its one of my favorite franchises, what about you\n",
      "oh ya I like it a lot, I like the orignal 3 the best though, the ones made from 1977 to 1983\n",
      "Yeah those are the best ones, I also lilke the Phantom Mennace, and thought that Solo: A Star Wars Story was also interesting, its curious how the movies started from the fourth and then restarted when the reached the sixth one\n",
      "ya that is weird, I didn't like ROgue One or The Last Jedi I thought they were horrible personally\n",
      "Yeah I didnt like those either and Solo wasnt great either but it was a good movie, I think the essence of the franchise is lost\n",
      "yup I agree, and I think James Earl Jones didn't get paid enough for the first movie!\n",
      "How much did James Earl get paid?\n",
      "only like 8k for the first movie, thats depressing\n",
      "It is, hopefully he got a better deal for the other ones, George Lucas has a  great imagination for surehe had a big influence on James Cameron\n",
      "ya I hope so, yup I agree, also I don't think Lucas' wife gets enough credit for the changes she made to star wars\n",
      "I agree shes a big reason of the success of the franchise, \n",
      "yup, she made changes like having obi wan die, very iconic!\n",
      "Yeah that was a nice touch, I bet Obi Wan would disagree though lol\n",
      "haha well I know alec Guiness hated the character in real life so maybe not lol\n",
      "He did? then scratch that, Obi Wan must agree lol, you know that the 20th Century Fox conviced Lucas to keep licensing and merchandising rights for the franchise if he decided to forgo his directing fee\n",
      "haha I did, that probably cost the studio billions! but it did make Lucas massively rich!\n",
      "Yeah they sure regretted that decision later, their lack of faith cost them millions I guess they deserve it do you like Game of Thrones?\n",
      "haha nice! I do like GOT btw, weird that some of the characters are related to charles dickens and charlie chaplin\n",
      "Yeah that is kind of weid, you know that the actor that plays The Mountain is actually only 25 years old,\n",
      "wow that seems so young, I remember when it started back in 2011, that seems so long ago!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, do you like star wars?\n",
      "who doesnt like star wars?! love star wars!\n",
      "Me too! I just saw the last jedi and really liked it. I was surprised to find out that James Earl Jones only spent 2.5 hours recording darth vader's lines in star wars.\n",
      "he was the perfect choice for that voice! the man got paid a pittance too, i figure, since the movie was so successful.\n",
      "Me too. Give the man some back end points. I bet he gets a ton of money from conventions though. I would demand at least $1M. Make it worth my time, if Im him...\n",
      "yeah, the points for the movies, the toys, the conventions, man, he could start his own film company.\n",
      "I know! In 2018 . the total value of the franchise was $65B!!!!\n",
      "amazing! I figure that George started an empire, not an evil one though. what is he doing these days?\n",
      "Nothing! He was bought out by disney for half a gazillion dollars! Must be nice!\n",
      "i guess. i would get bored. you need something to do everyday. i think he must be involved with films.\n",
      "I know he is. He gets $500K in directing fees. It made him a billionaire!\n",
      "Yes, he sure had some foresight there. he knew that toys could be worth a lot. he had money from previous films.\n",
      "I know. I wonder if they knew minera mouse's worth? That's short for minnie mouse.\n",
      "That is an odd name. I wonder who chose Minerva. greek goddess?\n",
      "I am not sure. Was it walter elias disney?\n",
      "perhaps disney did. he worked with a lot of creative people.\n",
      "Pixar actually named Wall-e as a tip of the hat to him. Who knew!\n",
      "that is a great tribute to the man who started it all. that was a great film. i should watch it again.\n",
      "There was only like 4 words spoken the entire film. THat's crazy.\n",
      "yes, i liked that fact. no talking. just visuals. very clever. Anyway, great chat!\n",
      "Ditto! Have a great day!\n",

      "Are you a Spiderman fan? Have you seen 'Into the Spiderverse'?\n",
      "Haven't seen it. I wonder about the need for all these remakes.\n",
      "Well, this is a whole different type of movie.  Miles Morales is the main Spidey, not Peter Parker.  There are other new movies for the holiday season also.  \"Mary Poppins\", \"How the Grinch Stole Chirstmas\", etc.\n",
      "The Grinch and Mary Poppins are classics. I guess that a younger audience might want updated versions of these, but I wouldn't. I can see that some series, like Harry Potter, need expansion because the fans are looking for new stories.\n",
      "Yes, that is true. Well I'm a big comic book fan.  Spider-Man was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.  There have been 10 live-action films. \n",
      "The basic Spiderman story is pretty flexible and can be reimagined with a new director and star. Have you heard that there was a Garfiled comic book series in which Garfield was a superhero? I don't think it would make Garfield entertaining.\n",
      "No, I hadn't heard that.  I heard that the US military is trying to achieve Spider-Man like abilities for their soldiers.  That's pretty cool.\n",
      "I wonder what kind of uniform those troops would get to wear. I think Stan Lee had a pretty interesting life, but he probably didn't understand Hollywood. He ended up getting $0 for the first Spider Man movie.\n",
      "I think by the end, he was getting some good paydays.  Joe Perry, the lead guitarist from Aerosmith performed the opening for the 1990's Spider-Man animated series. \n",
      "I guess Joe Perry was a Spider Man fan! I know Stan Lee ended up getting $1 million per year just to stay alive! That's a pretty good incentive. The number of registered superheroes in the US exceeds 300, but I can't imagine all of them getting movies.\n",
      "Yes it is.  Did you know there is a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes.  That's pretty funny. \n",
      "The little people behind the scenes putting everything back together. I guess that would be a steady job. Stan Lee reimagined DC Comics characters. I thought there would be a rule against doing characters of your competitor.\n",
      "I did too.  There are actually over 300 registered superheroes in the US. \n",
      "I wonder what superpowers are left after 300 superheroes. What is your favorite superpower?\n",
      "I would love invurnability.  A funny think is that there is a superhero called \"Normalman\".  He is the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes. \n",
      "Normalman. I wonder if that is considered cool, or if he just got laughed at all the time. Women might date him just because he was a freak.\n",
      "Good point there. I loved Stan Lee.  What a creative person.  He ended every telephone call with the word \"excelsior\". \n",
      "I bet people would call him just to hear him say Excelsior. I know that Marvel trademarked the names superhero and supervillain.\n",
      "They did, I not sure I knew that.  But, I did know that the largest public comic book collection in the world is at Michigan State University. \n",
      "I think the history of the medium is worth the examination of professors. There is much to learn about American culture from comics!\n",
      "Well, thanks for the chat.  Happy New Year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a spider man fan?\n",
      "I am, how about you?!\n",
      "I've been a fan since I read one of the comic books when I was a kid.\n",
      "My uncle is big in the comic book industry and was actually friends with Stan Lee who created Spider man.\n",
      "That is awesome!  I might have crossed paths with him at a comic con convention somewhere. I would love to go to the San Diego one.  Did you know that Stan Lee used to end every phone conversation he had with the word \"excelsior!\"\n",
      "That is hilarious. I did not. It is cool that the us military is trying to achieve spiderman like abilities for their soldiers.\n",
      "That is neat!  Did you know that DC stands for Detective Comics?\n",
      "I always wondered that. Crazy that there are over 300 registered superheroes in the US.\n",
      "That is crazy.  The Michigan State University holds the largest available comic book collection in the world.  Neat!\n",
      "Thats crazy. My favorite superhero is definitely normalman. \n",
      "Nice!  He was the only person without superpowers right?\n",
      "Yep, in a planet full of superheroes. Must have been boring for him.\n",
      "lol  There was a comic series about fixing collateral damage caused by superheroes.  I'm not familiar with that one.\n",
      "That is interesting. Me neither. There was actually a Garfield book series spinoff called pet force that featured Garfield and a gang of heroes.\n",
      "That would be neat!  I was a big Garfield fan when I was a kid.  Did you know the first comic book released  in the US was in 1933 and was called Famous Funnies?\n",
      "I heard it was a reprinting of earlier news comic strips.\n",
      "Interesting.  I wasn't sure of the content.  I didn't know that Joe Perry from Aerosmith performed the opening to the 1990's Spider Man animated series.\n",
      "That is cool. Stan Lee actually received nothing from the first spider man.\n",
      "I never knew that.  Wow.  The US military is trying to achieve Spider Man like abilities for the soldiers.  That would be neat to see.\n",
      "That would be. Guess they will be able to swing from place to place instead of using tanks! HA\n",
      "yes! lol It was nice chatting with you!  I have to get going.  Have a good day!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you read Spider-Man comics?\n",
      "No, but I watch the movies.  Spidey six apparently will have more than one bad guy to take down.\n",
      "That's cool.     I really enjoyed the new animated one with Miles Morales.\n",
      "I like them all.  When spider man married mary jane in 1987, marvel acutally had a public wedding with actors dressed in character and stan lee officiating.  How cool!\n",
      "I wonder if anyone ever would've guessed that when the character was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko\n",
      "Guessed that Spider man would get married?  Well, who would've guessed that the US military would try to make spider-man abilities for their soldiers?\n",
      "Guessed the popularity of the characters.    Even rock stars like Steve Perry wanted in on the action!\n",
      "Stan Lee gets 10% of the net profits from anything based upon his characters.  Since he died, I wonder who gets the fortune now?\n",
      "I heard that money was still in legal limbo, since the producers claimed it did not make any profit\n",
      "With 300 registered superheroes to choose from, who is your favorite?\n",
      "I really loved pet force which featured garfield the cat and gang as superheroes\n",
      "That is funny!  Stan Lee actually wrote 15 dc comics and re-imagined many of the popular superheroes including batman and superman.  He was a gem.\n",
      "He certainly understood the nature of those possessing supernatural or superhuman powers\n",
      "I wonder who wrote the comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes?\n",
      "I know in the real world, the total damage in American comic book and films since the 1930s would be unmeasurable!\n",
      "One superhero is called Normalman and his was the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes.  I wonder if he did any damage?\n",
      "Perhaps not, but with many worlds like the marvel cinematic universe in earth-199999, I guess resources are unlimited too!\n",
      "Do you read comics?  Marvel published a \"generic comic book\" just to trademark the words \"super-hero\" and \"super-villain.\"  Who do you root for?\n",
      "I like many characters and would love to see the michigan state university library, which has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world\n",
      "Do you know that DC stands for detective comics?  I didn't think of them as detectives so much.\n",
      "Batman was.    i need to go now, so as Stan Lee ended every phone conversation he had -  \"excelsior!\"\n",
      "Too bad we had to say a final goodbye to Lee with his passing.  I guess I'll watch some more of J.K. Rowling's new movie \"Fantastic Beasts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi are you a fan of pianos?\n",
      "I know how to play one.  I am not great though\n",
      "That's awesome!  I could never play.  I've played around with them when I've been around them and my fingers just don't work the keys anywhere near remotely close to how they should. lol  An aluminum grand piano was built for the lounge of the airship Hindenburg.  It weighed only 356 pounds.\n",
      "I would have thought it would have been a lot more.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I know right?  In 2006 a group of climbers reached the top of Britain's highest mountain and found a piano. lol Wonder how it got there?\n",
      "Someone must have been playing a trick on someone else.  That's what I would bet.  \n",
      "That had to have been a task for sure getting up there. lol  Freddie Mercury used the same piano to record \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" as Paul McCartney used to record \"Hey Jude\".  That's kind of neat.\n",
      "That is kind of neat.  I wonder what other stars used the same instruments?\n",
      "I'm not sure.  On April 18, 1930 the BBC decided there was no news worth reporting, so they just broadcast piano music instead! \n",
      "I bet that was funny to people.  There exists a song composed solely for stress testing auto-pianos, and it is not remotely playable by humans - circus galop.\n",
      "That is interesting!  Do you like listening to soundtracks?\n",
      "Not too much.  The soundtrack to 'o brother, where art thou?' is certified 8 times platinum\n",
      "That was a great one!  Phil Collins recorded the English, Italian, German, Spanish, and French versions of the Tarzan soundtrack.  That's some talent!\n",
      "That was some major talent.  Many artists have talent like that and we are totally unaware.\n",
      "Yes!  Each track on the Batman Begins soundtrack is the name of a genus or family of bat.  Interesting!\n",
      "That is very interesting.  I would have never figured that out.  \n",
      "Me neither.  Steven Spielberg played the clarinet in the Jaws soundtrack!\n",
      "I didn't even know he knew how to play the clarinet.  I thought he was just a filmmaker.\n",
      "Me too!  On a different subject...Panda researchers wear panda costumes to work!  lol It's been fun chatting!\n",
      "I love costumes.  I think that would be a cool job!!\n",
      "It would be!  Hope you have a great night!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi are you a fan of listening to soundtracks?\n",
      "Sometimes - I definitely loved the Dirty Dancing Soundtrack but not so much the Phantom Menace one.\n",
      "lol  I love a lot of those soundtracks from the 80s because I was a teenager then.  It's like listening to chapters of my life.  Did you know that Steven Spielberg played the clarinet on the Jaws soundtrack?\n",
      "I had never heard that.  I did know that Michael Jackson helped write the sonic 3 soundtrack\n",
      "I didn't know that.  The soundtrack to O Brother Where Art Thou is certified 8 times platinum!\n",
      "Wow that is crazy.  I did know the lead singer of Dire straights did the whole soundtrack for the Princess Bride.  That was an awesome movie!\n",
      "Yes.  It became a classic. I didn't know he did that either.  Phil Collins recorded the English, Italian, German, Spanish, and French versions of the Tarzan soundtrack.  What a feat!\n",
      "That is cool.  Someone made a big goof though when they released the Phantom Menace soundtrack before the movie  - it spoiled some of the plot!\n",
      "I didn't know that happened!  I bet the movie company didn't like that.  Each of the songs on the Batman Begins soundtrack all are the name of a genus or family of bat.\n",
      "Alicia Keys got to be on the Men In Black soundtrack when she was only 16.  That is pretty cool.\n",
      "Neat!  I didn't know that.  Switching gears....are you familiar with costumes?  Johnny Depp travels with his Capt. Jack Sparrow costume to make impromptu visits to sick kids in hospitals.  That's pretty cool of him to do!\n",
      "That is really cool.   Bob Denver lets make-a-wish kids rescue him from the island in full costume!\n",
      "Interesting. Is he still alive? lol  Panda researchers wear panda costumes to work.  lol\n",
      "That would be a great job!  Of course I would like to meet the guy who dresses up in a giraffe costume and does random acts of kindness!\n",
      "lol  Here's something interesting...the Hoggle costume from Labyrinth was lost in shipping and now resides at the unclaimed baggage museum in Alabama.  LOL  I'm surprised they didn't try to resell it!\n",
      "That is pretty funny - they did not give it back?  I think it is funny that the clone trooper costumes were never made - just computer generated\n",
      "Interesting.  They probably save a ton of money by doing that.  The uniforms worn by the alliance on Firefly are leftover costumes from Starship Troopers.\n",
      "Did you know that Hugh Jackman once walked around comic con in his full wolverine costume and no one even noticed him?\n",
      "haha I didn't know that.  That's pretty cool!  Sean Bean is so scared of flying that he hiked into location in full costume when filming the Lord of the Rings.\n",
      "wow that is crazy..     There is a great pianist on tv right now - do you play?\n",
      "I don't play but wish I could.  It was invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700.  Had no idea they were around that long.\n",
      "Richard Nixon was a good pianist - he even wrote a concerto and performed it on tv!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You ! :)\n",
      "Good morning! Did you know that an early typewriter was called a \"literary piano\"?\n",
      "lol - I guess there are certain similarities ;) it's got.... keys... ? ;)\n",
      "Yes. And in 2005, a mute man was found wandering somewhere in England and he could only communicate via piano, so that's kind of like the opposite - a piano being used like a typewriter.\n",
      "wow now that's an interesting allegory ;) I wonder how did he communicate... I mean... was he forming words somehow with keys ? \n",
      "Who knows. It would be interesting to learn more about what happened. Did you know that Mozart and Haydn both owned a piano made from the same tree?\n",
      "I really don't know if that's even a rare thing :) maybe all pianos were made from the same kind of tree. Or maybe You mean the same ACTUAL tree ?\n",
      "Yes, the actual individual tree.\n",
      "oh well now that's interesting ;) After all those years, how do we know it's true ;) they did the DNA tests on a tree ;) ?\n",
      "I don't know. I assume that they're going by piano makers' records from that time.\n",
      "Could be - Hey, You like Stephen Spielberg ?\n",
      "Not really. Did you know that every clone trooper costume is a computer generated image?\n",
      "Now it is... but in the original Star Wars it wasn't \n",
      "Yes, this was for the prequels. No physical clone trooper costume was ever produced for those films.\n",
      "What, not even a single one ? That's hard to believe... there were come close ups with troopers taking off their helmets... they had to make at least couple of them...\n",
      "GCI is pretty advanced these days.\n",
      "No, I know that but I think it's so much cooler to have couple of storm troopers outfits on set...\n",
      "I agree. Did you know that the Alien costume included real vertebrae?\n",
      "Wait... what ? but... was there an actor still inside ?\n",
      "Yes. It also included Rolls Royce auto parts.\n",
      "That had to be in early Alien - recent parts were probably all CGI... I miss that movie - I hope they'll make a decent sequel... or prequel - or whatever from that universe ;)\n",
      "Yes! I hope so! It's been great talking to you! Have a good day!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a fan of the Beatles?\n",
      "I like their music once in a while. They have the best selling album of the2000s.\n",
      "I find that amazing considering the last album they recorded was in 1969!  Did you know that the Beatles stopped touring because sound amplifiers, at that time, could not keep up over the screaming?\n",
      "Interesting! I find it fascinatingalso that the Beatles couldn't read music.\n",
      "I wonder how many other major musical stars cannot read music?  I can't read music or play either although I have an old player piano.  \n",
      "I used to play the piano and I enjoyed it. Have you heard of the piano that was found on the top of Britain's highest mountain?\n",
      "Yeah.  I remember reading about it.  They found it on a litter cleanup patrol.  Still don't have any idea how / why its up there!  Did you know that a piano linked Freddie Mercury of Queen and Paul McCartney of the Beatles?  Mercury used the piano to record \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and McCartney to record \"Hey Jude\"!\n",
      "Exactly! Wonder how it got there without anyone knowing. Another cool piano is that one on the Hindenburg airship\n",
      "It was made of aluminum, so I wonder if the accoustics was significantly different that  a wooden piano?  What I found entertaining was that in 1930, the BBC felt they had no news to report, so they broadcasted piano music.   I really wish they would do that weekly now to help alleviate the information overload!\n",
      "Yeah I rarely watch the news because it is so depressing.\n",
      "It can be depressing.  But for me, the issue is sorting fact from fiction.  It seems hard to get facts without the spin.  And some take basic facts, embellish them 1000% and then try to pass that fiction as \"truth\".  If I want fiction, then I will go to a movie or read a book!\n",
      "You are right! Do you like science fiction? \n",
      "Yes.  I just finished the last Harry Potter book.  I had seen all the movies years ago, but had not read the books until now.  Are you into law&order/crime novels like Robert Parker's \"Jesse Stone\" series?\n",
      "I am not really. Are those good? I really appreciate Edgar Allen Poe. He wrote the oldest example of a fictional cyborg.\n",
      "The original Jesse Stone novels are good.  Robert Parker died unexpectedly.  One would expect that the saga would end with the author's death.  But, a fan then starting releasing new \"Jesse Stone\" novels.  I found this \"fan fiction\" in bad taste since he was trying to mimic (very poorly) the original author's style.\n",
      "Yeah, I'm not really into fan fiction. Geroge RR Martin says that fan fiction is copyright infringement and a bad exercise for people wanting to be writers.\n",
      "I totally agree.  Do read superhero novels / comics?\n",
      "I used to when I was younger. Now I mostly watch Marvel series on Netflix.\n",
      "I recently found a wiki website online that ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abiliites.  Seems highly subjective to me.  But the same can be said of a person's taste in fictional genres. \n",
      "Interesting. I'll have to check that out. Julius Caesar liked fan fiction. He wrote fan fiction of Hercules and Oedipus when he was a kid.\n",
      "I could see a child fantasizing about their favorite hero or villain and then learning to write by using their imagination.  But, as adults, we should use our own creativity.  Like the Beatles.  They were original in their music compositions, even if they drifted into politics from time to time.\n",
      "That song Come Together is so catchy. Too bad it was written for politics!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a fan of The Beatles? I just learned that they had the best selling album of the 2000's.\n",
      "I am not a huge fan but that's crazy! Especially considering how influential they were decades ago, even writing for governor campaigns in the 1960s.\n",
      "Oh, you're talking about that song Come Together, right? T\n",
      "I think so! I don't know the details of it, but that's the one. Some of Beatles couldn't even read.\n",
      "Well, they could read. They couldn't read music though, which is surprising to me because of the music they made.\n",
      "They certainly just stuck with music and didn't care to adopt \"technology\". I believe they stopped touring cause their amplification couldn't drown out the loud screaming!\n",
      "Maybe they were just more interested in new recording techniques. They were really unconventional in the studio.\n",
      "Yeah and I think they had a lot of setbacks beyond their control. Like RIngo Starr had severe suberculosis and peritonitis, I'm sure that affected his ability to write music.\n",
      "Speaking of writing I just read this article about how Edgar Allen Poe wrote the earliest known example of a cyborg in fiction\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh wow, it's certainly interesting where inspiration in fiction comes from. Julius Caesar actually wrote fan fiction for fun, I had no idea it went back that long.\n",
      "lol, speaking of fan fiction, did you see George R. R. Martin rage over fan fiction? He said it's copyright infringement.\n",
      "I did not! I think that's interesting. People hate on fiction all the time it seems like. In the 1950s a judge tried to ban a comic for featuring a black character.\n",
      "wow. that's crazy. Who do you think has the best super power? I think superman. There's a whole wiki that ranks them.\n",
      "I think I'd have to see that wiki before making an opinion haha. On another note, are you interested in instruments at all?\n",
      "I mean a bit. I like piano. I like watching people play it, I like stringed musical instruments like that.\n",
      "Yeah i like the piano too! It seems it's beloved everywhere. In 1930 I know the BBC once thought there wasn't anything really newsworthy, so they just broadcasted piano music.\n",
      "haha, that's awesome. i read there was a song that can't be played by humans, that exists only to test the piano\n",
      "I wonder how they actually test that! It's funny the lengths people go with pianos. There's an aluminum grand piano for the lounge on Hindernburg.\n",
      "wow, you can find pianos everywhere, I guess. I heard there was one at the top of a britain's highest mountain. I guess they really like their pianos.\n",
      "I wonder how they found that! Do you know? It would be interesting if the same group of people discovered both that and the Hindenburg piano.\n",
      "maybe it fell out of the Hindenburg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a fan of reading fiction?\n",
      "Yes I am. I love Edgar allen poe \n",
      "He was awesome, I loved the raven! He coined the word cyborg, which is crazy because of how technology was so limited back then\n",
      "I agree. Julius caesar also wrote fan fiction. I have never read it though \n",
      "I havent either, it would be interesting to read it. did you hear in the 50s a judge tried banning science fiction?\n",
      "Yes because it featured a black character. He would not have liked the Black Panther lol\n",
      "lol not at all! That is so wrong, but that was the 50s unfortunately. Do you play any instruments?\n",
      "I play the Piano I love piano music so I would have loved to hear the bbc broadcast piano music show back in 1930\n",
      "Me too, i started playing at 7! I wish I still played more than I used to, but it is a good party trick to bust out! Freddie mercury and paul mccartney played on the same piano for different hit songs once\n",
      "I would love to play that piano too ! I can play bohemian rhapsody just as well as they can\n",
      "no way! I would love to learn that. Were you into the beatles much?\n",
      "I loved them as a kid. I was not born when they formed in 1960\n",
      "I wasn't either, they were amazing and still are. They couldn't even read music which is so interesting!\n",
      "That is something. ringo starr was illiterate due to a childhood illness. \n",
      "wow, I didnt know an illness could cause that. Look how far he came in life! what is it due to?\n",
      "Yes He did very well in his career. And they had the best selling album of the 2000's\n",
      "WHAT? that is so awesome. I wonder when they released their last song, do you know?\n",
      "Good question. I love the way they experimented with musical styles\n",
      "I agree, they stopped touring though because technology couldn't keep up with the screaming lol\n",
      "I could understand why. Now I know what the song \"come together\" was written for.\n",
      "for sure! It was so nice chatting with you! Take care!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, Do you like the Piano ? I have been playing for years. \n",
      "Is there a piano in \"come together\" by the Beatles?\n",
      "Electric piano I think. It was made for the 1969 california governor campaign\n",
      "Yeah...it sounds good. Wasn't Timothy Leary a drug guy?\n",
      "That I dont know. Did you know that the beatles could not read music ?\n",
      "Really. Could Ringo Starr read at all?\n",
      "He was illiterate for most of his childhood \n",
      "I wonder if thats what they were screaming about.\n",
      "lol the screaming stopped them from touring\n",
      "Well, come together for ye but not for me. Still, they had more #1s than anybody\n",
      "Do you like fiction ? I love Edgar allen poe\n",
      "Yeah, Poe is great. I just read some William Trevor\n",
      "Julius caesar was a good writer as well\n",
      "Really. Were there a lot of women characters, like there is in Trevor's \"Last Stories\"?\n",
      "Maybee the greek goddesses. Its sad how a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because of a black character\n",
      "he probably couldn't read either\n",
      "lol. I remember reading Edgar allen poe's work about a cyborg in high school\n",
      "That's being ahead of ones time. Hey jude and bohemian rhapsody were too, in their own ways\n",
      "Those are some excellent songs. Ringo is my favorite beetle \n",
      "Yeah...they both used the same piano. I'm not sure if they found it atop britain's highest mountain.\n",
      "I would love to try and play the circus galop song. Nice chatting, good night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello. How are you doing?\n",
      "I am doing great, how about you. Do you play music?\n",
      "Actually I dont but I really enjoy the piano. How about you?\n",
      "I used to play piano growing up, it has been a while though. Can make some great music with it!\n",
      "Did you know that the piano was invented around 1700 by Bartolomeo Cristofori.\n",
      "Wow, I never knew it was that long ago. I heard one time a group of hikers found a piano at the top of Britains highest mountain\n",
      "Wow I wonder how it got there. In 1930 the bbc broadcast piano music on april 18th because they didnt think there was any news worth reporting.\n",
      "I wonder too, that would be a hike! Piano music would be better to listen to most news days lol\n",
      "Did you know that there was a piano on the hindenburg. It was made out of aluminum. It only weighed 356 pounds.\n",
      "Wasn't the hindenburg the blimp that was engulfed by flames?\n",
      "Yeah because they used hydrogen to make it float. \n",
      "Wow, I wonder if that burned up or it survived the flames. Do you listen to any good soundtracks?\n",
      "I like the o brother where art thou soundtrack. It has a couple really catchy songs. It is actually certiied 8 times platinum.\n",
      "I loved that one, I bought that Cd when the movie came out! I bet they won that many, it was amazing and catchy yes\n",
      "Did you ever hear the batman begins soundtrack? Each track is the name o a genus or family of bat.\n",
      "No way! I have never heard that. I need to check it out lol. Tell you what a good soundtrack was, Tarzan's.\n",
      "That one was good. I have heard it in english french and germanso ar.Ill get it in every language beore I die.\n",
      "wow, no way, I knew Phil Collins had a big part in it, he sang it in those languages?\n",
      "That is pretty darn intelligent if he can speak all those languages. It is a very good soundtrack though. My son really likes it as well.\n",
      "my daughter loves it too. She is a big fan of the movie also. Me Tarzan, you Jane! lol. It was nice chatting with you!\n",
      "Nice chatting with you as well. Have a good night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the article was really good to read\n",
      "It was interesting.  I am a movie lover, so it was interesting to read some facts about movies and the box office.\n",
      "the facts was really close to me\n",
      "I find it fascinating how our movies really speak to what is going on in society.  Lately the movies that have been released are very closely related to the politics and problems going on in society.\n",
      "the said what the current society is going on\n",
      "The metoo movement has really influenced the movies that have been released in the last year.  Don't you think?  I think this can be both good and bad.\n",
      "its really good of the issue\n",
      "I like that movies bring about conversation about important topics, but on the other hand it can be a little too much to hear about nothing else except the problems going on in society.  Sometimes, I just want to watch a mindless action movie with no deeper meaning.\n",
      "yes the every had to watch it deeper meaning\n",
      "I have to say that even though I like movies, I have no interest in the awards show.  They feel like a waste of time and I think they have just become a political platform for a lot of people.  \n",
      "the watching a shows must be worth off it\n",
      "as far as movies are concerned, it's funny how they always talk about how much money they earn in the box office.  Those numbers always sound so outrageous.  I can't even fathom the amount of money a movie can make in one weekend.\n",
      "yes comedy shows always show a good concept\n",
      "Yes, comedies are always fun to watch.  And they tend to be light hearted so you can just enjoy it and not think about a deeper meaning.  I wonder it comedies do well at the box office in comparison to other genres.\n",
      "it really good to see\n",
      "There was a movie recently with Lady Gaga that came out.  It is interesting to see a singer cross the lines into acting.  I heard it was a good movie, and I do like her music.\n",
      "the lady gaga has an good talent\n",
      "Did you see her movie, 'A start is Born'  I didn't realize it was a remake of an older movie.\n",
      "yes i saw\n",
      "Would you recommend it?  I was thinking about seeing it.  I like some of the other people in the movie.\n",
      "the every character acted well\n",
      "Thanks.  I think I will go see it.  I enjoyed talking about movies with you.  Thanks.\n",
      "thank you\n",
      "Bye\n",
      "\n",

      "Do you know who Julia Mancuso is?\n",
      "I just know that she is the most decorated women's skier.\n",
      "She is. Did you know she retired right before the Olympics?\n",
      "I did not really know this, why did she decide to do this?\n",
      "Seems like it was mostly because of a hip injury.\n",
      "Seems she really wanted to do her 5th Olympics and fought until the end but in the end she just couldn't do it.\n",
      "I think so.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had people who questioned and doubted her but her husband supported her. I'm happy for that.\n",
      "That is good.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said it was an emotional time when she realized it was going to be too hard on her body.\n",
      "I bet. Did you know she also released a line of lingerie at one point?\n",
      "Haha, they were called Kiss My Tiara. Sounds kind of like it has double meanings. I like how she said you can be femine and fast.\n",
      "Yes it was.  Do you know anything about the FIFA World Cup?\n",
      "I don't know much about it. When the US competed in the first FIFA world cup in 1930, they got 3rd place.\n",
      "Yes they did.  The city that is hosting the 2022 final does not exist yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "And cities that host the World Cup don't even get an economic gain from it.\n",
      "I know. What do you know about Wonder Woman?\n",
      "Gal Gadot didn't know that she was auditioning for Wonder Woman. She thought she was testing for catwoman.\n",
      "I know.  When Wonder Woman first appeared as a member of the Justice Society, she was the secretary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since she's Israeli she had to serve two years as a soldier. WOnder if that helped her in her role at all.\n",
      "Yes it did.\n",
      "I haven't watched the film at all. I'll have to go check it out right now. Have a good day!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, do you follow soccer?\n",
      "Hi, I'm not a soccer aficionado. My husband and I did go to a San Jose Earthquakes game a couple of years ago because they had built a stadium nearby. I have to admit we were bored.\n",
      "I have to agree, I don't understand what is exciting about it.  But most of the rest of the world clearly loves it.  I wonder what city the 2022 world cup is going to be in that doesn't yet exist?\n",
      "Without looking it up, my guess is that Qatar is building a city to host it. Which would be pretty amazing. How about Wonder Woman? Did  you see it? What did you think?\n",
      "I did see it, even though I'm not a huge superhero movie person.  I thought it was ok, but nothing that great.  Its always good to see a woman getting some of this superhero movie money.  Did you see it?\n",
      "I did see it and liked it. It was during the period that my granddaughter imagined Wonder Woman everywhere saving people. I liked the fact that in 2017 the 3 highest grossing domestic films were female led. \n",
      "Yes, I think thats great too.  Hopefully that will encourage the studios to make more movies with women. I'm surprised it was also the highest grossing ww1 movie\n",
      "It seems a stretch to call it a WWI movie, in  my opinion. I would think a WWI movie would show more soldiers in battle rather than a fictitious superhero movie.\n",
      "Sure.  Of course I've seen South Pacific too, and I don't know how you can really call that a female led movie.  Or cat on a hot tin roof either, that was mainly Paul Newman\n",
      "Good point! On another note, things have changed since 1941 when Wonder Woman was Justice Society's secretary.\n",
      "I didn't know that, a lot of things have changed for the better since 1941!  Gal Gadot is beautiful and I bet she could kick but in real life since she served in the Israeli army\n",
      "Absolutely. Regarding the moon, I don't get how someone believed Mar's largest moon might be artificial in origin. I may have to dig into that one a bit. If artificial, who put it there?\n",
      "And I'm curious how they know its actually hollow, although that is very interesting\n",
      "Speaking of the moon - if you had all the money you needed, would you sign up to go to the moon on one of those private rockets that will be going there?\n",
      "I might consider it, but they would have to prove to me that it was safe.  And I would take a lot of convincing.  How about you?\n",
      "Probably not although it is just fascinating to me how that journey has changed since USA planted its flag on the moon. \n",
      "I'm fascinated that moon dust can cut through kevlar-like material.  To my knowledge the moon is made up of the same stuff as the ear, so I may have to look that up\n",
      "The ear?? Wax and all?\n",
      "I meant the earth!  Also I've never heard of moon hay fever.\n",
      "Me neither. I suppose I don't need to worry too much about it since I won't be traveling there.\n",
      "Good talk, thanks\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you think gender and race are equally worthy of attention in judging films?\n",
      "I think they are both very important issues and essential in the progression towards equality\n",
      "Should the Oscars consider these factors on an equal basis when making awards?\n",
      "Yes, I think these factors should be considered on an equal basis though perhaps how the movies present the issues and bring awareness to them is more important.\n",
      "I agree with that.  What about box office draw, should that be considered in the Oscar evaluation?\n",
      "I don't think it should, though it probably does have impact on the Oscars. What do you think?\n",
      "I think that what people like to see should have an impact.  After all, they pay to see the movies, the critics get in free.  \n",
      "Ha. That's true. Have you watched any of films that present social justice issues, like The Public or The Hate U Give?\n",
      "No, I've missed those, kinda on purpose.  I like documentaries but not that type.\n",
      "Social justice movies are kind of depressing. The only movies I watch are cartoons with my kids.\n",
      "Now, I don't much care for animation although I did like Ferdinand.  I like drama and sci-fi and some horror, some action adventure.\n",
      "Do you usually watch the Oscars?\n",
      "No, I do look at the red carpet stills the day after though.\n",
      "Have you watched The Old Man & the Gun? It is a 2018-2019 Oscar hopeful.\n",
      "No, I haven't seen that.  What's it about?\n",
      "I looked it up and it's about a 70 year old making an escape from San Quentin and conducting various heists.\n",
      "Oh, yeah, I remember hearing something.  I don't know that it would be too appealing to me.\n",
      "It sounds quite humorous but I bet it is filled with a lot of action.\n",
      "Oh, I didn't realize it had a comedy aspect to it. I'll have to check out Rotten Tomatoes!\n",
      "Oh, I'm not sure that it does. I just thought it was funny that an \"old man\" was pulling off lots of heists after escaping from prison. So you like comedy but not action?\n",
      "No I like action just not when it glorifies criminals.  Hey, nice chatting with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, do you know much about the box office?\n",
      "In fact, I was recently studying up on box offices. How about you?\n",
      "I know a little bit. With over $8.5 billion worldwide in film earnings, Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office star.\n",
      "The guy is a money machine. He has the golden touch. He could just stand there and the money would flow in for a film.\n",
      "I agree. Did you know Disney once thought about shutting down its animation studio after Sleeping Beauty was a box office failure?\n",
      "I guess they expected to always make money. Many of those animated films have been popular for decades. There is a long curve.\n",
      "I saw the movie The Trojan Wars had a budget of $15 million and only earned $309 in the box office. Talk about a failure.\n",
      "What's the saying? \"Nobody know anything.\" Hollywood execs just can't predict. Adjusted for inflation, the original star wars trilogy out-earned the prequels at the domestic box office by $1,328,009,800. That's insane. \n",
      "Wow that's crazy! Disney's Treasure Planet was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time.\n",
      "Somebody lost their job over that one. Sometimes it's different by country. Despite \"john carter\" being considered a monumental flop for Disney, it actually broke box office records in Russia\n",
      "Oh wow that's pretty cool. I saw Silence of the Lambs came out on Valentine's Day in 1991 and had a box office of over $270 million.\n",
      "A perfect V-Day movie. The blood, the dread. Perfect!\n",
      "HAHA I bet! Do you like birds?\n",
      "I like to eat them. Not much else. LOL\n",
      "LOL! The dodo bird is actually a sub-family of the pigeon.\n",
      "I guess \"dumb\" runs in the family then.\n",
      "I guess so - lol. Some birds fly from Alaska to Northern Mexico without sleeping when they are migrating.\n",
      "I don't understand how they can fly without sleep. Amazing. \n",
      "Me either. Such an amazing feat.\n",
      "Pigeons are one of 3 birds that produce milk for their young. I didn't know that birds produced milk. I thought that was only mammals.\n",
      "Wow, I didn't know that either. It was great talking to you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "I'm doing good, how about yourself?\n",
      "I am well, thanks! Do you watch the olympics?\n",
      "I do! Did you hear that Julia Mancuso retired? She was such a great skier!\n",
      "I had never hear of her before but it sounds like she will be missed!\n",
      "I remember seeing her in the 2010 and 2014 games. She was really good. It'll be good for her body though. She just had hip surgery not too long ago.\n",
      "Lindsey Vonn just retired too, or at least announced it. It sounds like US Skiing is going to have a leadership vacuum that will need to be filled...\n",
      "Yep I'm sure there's some greats waiting in the wing. It's crazy they're both 34. It goes to show that athletes endure so much that it's hard to compete into their 30s.\n",
      "I worry about their long term health. I know a lot of ex-football players that are going through a lot of physical pain, let alone brain issues.\n",
      "It has to be a rough life. It's hard to beat on your body and train to be the best every day.\n",
      "Yeah. The recovery time on a lot of them is a long time Even with baseball it takes a few months to recover from a 162 game season.\n",
      "I can imagine. I bet soccer players have a hard time recovering too. I've never played, but watching the World Cup makes me tired. They're always moving, sprinting, stopping. It has to take a toll.\n",
      "Yeah, they have to run about 10 miles a game, no?\n",
      "I think so, I don't even like driving 10 miles, much less running. They have to be in incredible shape.\n",
      "Yeah. Like Gal Gadot in WOnder woman. Have you seen that movie?\n",
      "I have not. I've been wanting to see it, I just haven't had the time. It seems to be pretty good.\n",
      "Yeah, I thought Gadot was perfectly cast. I think almost everyone enjoyed it, that I talked to about it.\n",
      "I will definitely have to check it out. \n",
      "It was the highest grossing super hero origin movie. \n",
      "Oh wow! That's awesome. It's good to finally have a female superhero in the spotlight and to do so well.\n",
      "Nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi how are you? do you like birds?\n",
      "I do.  I love hummingbirds but had no idea that they steal spiderwebs to make their nests!\n",
      "they are cunning little thieves arent they? LOL. I guess they are too quick to stop. they take what they want and flit away.\n",
      "Yes - they are so tiny - and like most birds their bones are hollow so that their entire skeleton weighs less than their feathers!\n",
      "that makes sense. hollow bones are lighter but also stronger. interesting how evolution produced that.\n",
      "Yes as a skydiver I wish I could fly like a bird, though I will say I prefer flying Jetblue over flying from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping while migrating\n",
      "i cant imagine how birds do that. they must have some calm sleeplike state or something.\n",
      "And it has to be tiring!   That is a long flight!!!!!\n",
      "It sure is. worse than flying in economy class. i respect the birds for their stamina. its cute that they can imitate machines and stuff.\n",
      "Yes Parrots are great imitators - I saw one on facebook which kept insulting firefighters when they were trying to rescue it.\n",
      "that is great! i bet the firefighters appreciated that! \"hey! we're trying to save you!\"\"\n",
      "hahahahahha For sure - they should sell tickets to parrot shows at the box office - watch them try and talk to Alexa or something\n",
      "LOL. that would be funny. do you like lady gaga? i dont know her well.\n",
      "I do not know a lot about her  - I do know her name came about from an autocorrect\n",
      "that is funny. lady gaga. she sure can sing. she likes iron maiden.\n",
      "She is really popular - so popular in fact that the LAPD asked her to tweet out info about road construction\n",
      "she is followed by so many. i think that was good thinking by the lapd. she would probably want to help. good for her.\n",
      "Elton John chose her as his son's godmother - that says a lot about what type of person she is\n",
      "she must get respect from other musicians. anyway, great chat!\n",
      "She was even on MTV before she was famous!\n",
      "she really pursued success. Have a good day!\n",
      "She does!\n",

      "Hi!  Did you watch the new Wonder Woman movie?\n",
      "no, i have not seen it. i have heard some good things about it though. You?\n",
      "I have not, but I saw the star, Gal Gadot on the talk show circuit promoting the movie. \n",
      "she is great for the part! i bet she did a great job. what other movies has she been in, do you know?\n",
      "As Wonder WOman, she was in 2016 Batman Vs Superman\n",
      "oh, ok, so she does a lot of superhero films. I bet she a good athlete too. \n",
      "I think so. She served two years in the Isreali defense forces, so she is trained for combat.\n",
      "she is tough and gorgeous. a perfect combo for wondrous women. \n",
      "Right. And the box office loves her. WW is the highest grossing superhero origin movie\n",
      "that is great. i heard that when she first appeared as a member of the justice society in 1941, the group made her their secretary. that is messed up. \n",
      "Well, Aqua man would get all the paperwork wet... Gadot did not even know she was auditioning for Wonder Woman... She thought she was going for Catwoman...\n",
      "I dont see her as a catwoman so much. i liked michelle pfeiffer for that. \n",
      "I agree! Did you see her in the movie, Wolf? I would howl at the moon with her anytime!\n",
      "I did not. wait. was jack nicholson in that? maybe i did.\n",
      "Yes. Ooooooo!  The moon is the Earth's only permanent natural satellite. Wolfs have been howling at it for eons!\n",
      "I like the moon, but not enough to howl at it. maybe im just not a fan. \n",
      "Well, maybe you have not met the right moon?  There is evidence of methane based life on Titan, a moon of Saturn. Who knows...\n",
      "I guess that we could send some people out there. maybe safer that the moon. Moon dust cuts through kevlar-like material and is harmful to humans\n",
      "Or, we could send someone to Phobos, Mars's largest moon. It's hollow. Wouldn't it be cool to know what it looks like inside?\n",
      "Yes, i figure that space exploration is the next step for humankind.  Anyway, great chat!\n",
      "Yeah, and the FIFA World Cup is the future of American Sports! Nice chatting!\n",
      "Boy, i hope so. We need more soccer in this country. Have a good night!\n",
      "Bye bye!\n",

      "I do! My five year old loves it too\n",
      "That's good. My children love libraries too!\n",
      "I see that ships visiting ancient alexandria would need to surrender their books so they could copy them\n",
      "That's interesting. There are more libraries than McDonald's in the US. \n",
      "That's a good thing, right? hah. Have you seen Wheres Waldo in a while?\n",
      "I have not seen Where's Waldo in a long time. I used to love Waldo growing up.\n",
      "Apparently he shows up in the same locations, so one can predict where he is and find him within 10 seconds\n",
      "Interesting. Do you like literature?\n",
      "I do. I also see that a doctor in west texas teaches heavy metal as literature\n",
      "Very cool. The FDA burned six tons of literature in an act of US censorship.\n",
      "Weird. Apparently Stephen King wrote a childrens book under a pseudonym and reviews it as himself.\n",
      "Interesting. In 1953, Winston Churchill won a Nobel price for literature.\n",
      "I wonder what he wrote?\n",
      "It doesn't say, but I'm curious as well.\n",
      "\"The Fonz\" also wrote an 18 book childrens series about a dyslexic character because he was dyslexic too.\n",
      "Wow that's interesting..\n",
      "He modeled a character after the one teacher who helped him with reading.\n",
      "That's very cool. Good for him.\n",

      "Hi there! Isn't it great that we have access to so much literature and great libraries?\n",
      "yes wonderful! Did you know the FDA burned 6 tons of literature in an act of censorship?\n",
      "No! That is awful. There are actually more libraries in the world than Mcdonalds restaurants.\n",
      "Oh wow,  thats good\n",
      "I agree. In the US over half of adults have library cards.\n",
      "Hey!  i am one of those adults! lol\n",
      "Yes, me too. It's pretty cool that A library of things was started in Sacramento.\n",
      "thats kinda cool,  you can rent out certain items. \n",
      "Yes, items like sewing machines and things people find useful but do not need for long term ownership.\n",
      "it looks like there is an annual contests amoung authors to come up with the worse opening line to a book. \n",
      "That sounds like it would be fun to be a part of.\n",
      "architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpture were olympic events for awhile lol\n",
      "Boy, they need to bring that back. UK Prime Minister Gladstone had a personal book collection of 32,000 books that he donated to the library by wheelbarrowing them.\n",
      "Wow!  That is amazing.  Too bad they couldnt find a more secure way to transport the books.  lol Do you know winston churchill?\n",
      "I guess it was his wishes to do so that way. Yes, I am familiar with WC.,\n",
      "He has a nobel prize in literature. \n",
      "Oh that is interesting since those are usually considered to be associated with peace.\n",
      "yeah.  I hear if you publish a book in Norway the government buys 1000 to donate to libraries. \n",
      "That sounds pretty generous! \n",
      "i know right!  This is funny, Dr. seuss's editor bet him $50 he couldnt write a book in 50 words or less... the editor lost the bet lol\n",
      "I like that bet! Did you know children's books have more rare words than average adult TV?\n",
      "That is hilarious.  lol Its been great talking with you, thanks for all the info. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello - do you like libraries?\n",
      "Hi, how are you? Yes, I love libraries.\n",
      "I'm great thank you. There are more libraries than McDonald's in the United States.\n",
      "I can't believe it! We love our fast food more than reading! Maybe if we combine the two. \n",
      "I agree. \n",
      "We could have a fast food section at every library, or a library section at every McDonalds. It would be great! \n",
      "haha - do you like literature?\n",
      "Yes, I do like literature, though I do not understand it. I think that it is for people smarter than me.\n",
      "The FDA burned six tons of literature in an act of US censorship.\n",
      "I think that is appalling. Who are they to decide what I can't read? That is not for the gov't.\n",
      "I have no idea lol. I agree that it's appalling.\n",
      "I think that the gov't should encourage people to read widely. That is the job of gov't. Are we all children here?\n",
      "I think so too. Romantic kissing is a fairly recent development and is rarely mentioned even in ancient Greek literature.\n",
      "I can't imagine that. Maybe people's breath was stanking.\n",
      "I can't imagine that either.\n",
      "I figure that maybe kissing is something that only humans do. Maybe it is unnatural. I wonder what other kinky secrets can be found in literature.\n",
      "If you publish a book in Norway, the government will buy 1000 copies and distribute them to libraries throughout the country.\n",
      "I will move to Norway then. I will write many children's book and publish them and marry a beautiful woman and have many children.\n",
      "LOL. That sounds like a good idea!\n",

      "I love comedy films. What is your favorite comedy?\n",
      "I love them too, especially bromantic comedies. My favorites are Step Brothers or pineapple express. How about you?\n",
      "I like pineapple express, it was really funny. I liked Evan almighty a lot.\n",
      "I liked that too, I heard that movie costed a lot of money to make\n",
      "Yes in fact it had a budget of $200 million. Isn't that insane for a comedy!!!\n",
      "wow, very insane, if I remember right they had tons of big names in it. Good movie though. Do you like Bill Murray?\n",
      "I love Bill Murray. Do you have any movie suggestions for me that involve comedy?\n",
      "Blades of Glory is a classic, This is the end, so many, Any Bill Murray film. Have you seen Kung Fu Hustle?\n",
      "Yes I have, very funny movie. That was a classic right there. Thanks\n",
      "I have never seen it before, I think Bill Murray said it was comedy gold or something like that.\n",
      "I agree. Did you know that some of the very first silent movies out there were comedies?\n",
      "I did, Charlie Chaplin was great. It was amazing that they didn't even have to talk to make people laugh\n",
      "You're correct those types of movies were all visual and they didn't require any sound whatsoever.\n",
      "For sure! Do you like comedians?\n",
      "I do like comedians do you have someone in mind?\n",
      "Demetri martin and ryan stiles. One is a drop out of high school and one is a drop out of law school, both successful and funny\n",
      "Wow!!! I didn't know this. Did you know that originally the Green Lantern was suppose to be a comedy?\n",
      "That may have made it better, lol! The movie was blah. Was Ryan Reynolds supposed to be in that one also?\n",
      "I believe so but also Jack Black was suppose to start in that movie as well.\n",

      "i dont know much about shakespeare. Lay some wisdom on me!\n",
      "I was hoping the same.  I guess we've come to an impasse.  I do know he is the inventor of some of the names we now commonly use.\n",
      "He created a ton of words. Shakespeare coined or popularized many of the phrases we use today.\n",
      "I guess we owe him a lot, if you are into words that is.  I know he wrote some comedies, I've been told by some that know that you won't get much of a laugh from them.\n",
      "yeah, i bet. we dont really know his culture or setting. His works take on a different meaning when performed with an era-appropriate accent instead of a modern one, often introducing rhymes or puns that don't work in modern pronunciations.\n",
      "That sounds like too much work for me, I just want to bang on a DVD and watch some Bill Murray.\n",
      "Yes, i figure bill is more the taste of the modern man. do you agree with his thinking on Kung Fu Hustle?\n",
      "I have not see it so can't pass judgement, I'm guessing there is some tongue in cheek action there.  Was he is that one?\n",
      "No, he wasnt. i expect he was being facetious. i have not seen the film. ive heard good things, but is it the pinnacle of comedy? i doubt it.\n",
      "Oscar Wilde seem to have considered himself a comedian, I have nothing to declare but my genius.  Either he's a comedian or he rally was full of himself.\n",
      "he was both. the man wrote some great plays, and was quite popular. but he was a bit pompous too. \n",
      "I once saw a version of The Importance of Being Earnest in the theater, I guess the'y call  it a comedy of manners.  I know there have been a couple of comedy movies version made.\n",
      "Yeah, i read that in high school. i liked it but it is more fun to see it performed.\n",
      "Do you really think his last words were about a dual with his wallpaper to the death.  Sounds too good to be true.\n",
      "The man had some weird predilections, but i think it comes with being an artist. Kissing oscar wilde's lipstick covered tomb could result in a $12,000 fine! What is up with that?\n",
      "I once went to see it with a friend, in the same cemetery as Jim Morrison I believe.  People have turned the place into  a shrine with messages and gifts all over the place.  Lots of graffiti.\n",
      "Ah, that is why there is a fine. I guess he is beloved figure and people want to pay...respect?\n",
      "If they have to have a fine for kissing it there must have been hundreds, if not thousands that have.  I think I'd want to keep my lips well away from that.\n",
      "Yeah, boy, who knows what is lurking on that gravestone. Anyway, great chat!\n",
      "Have a good day, or evening.  I'm going to go and stream Kung Fu Hustle now.  Bye.\n",

      "How's it going, have you ever heard of the movie \"Who Paid the Piper\"?\n",
      "I haven't heard of it, what is it about?\n",
      "It's is based on how the CIA started a cultural war to stomp out communism, sounds like it's an interesting flick\n",
      "That does sound interesting. Do you ride the subway often?\n",
      "Not unless I'm in a major city like NYC or DC. The subway in DC have exclusive subway lines for congressmen\n",
      "That sounds pretty convenient! Did you know Elmo was the only non human to testify before US congress? I wonder what that was like..\n",
      "Lol no, I wonder what congress had Elmo testifying about\n",
      "I have no idea. The first woman who was elected to congress couldn't even vote. That's pretty surprising!\n",
      "That's a shame that women couldn't even vote in a national election back in 1916\n",
      "Yeah,  it is. It's crazy that so many things like that were happening and not even that long ago.\n",
      "Yea, it's crazy how far the US congress has come since it was started in 1789\n",
      "Since 1909 congress has had a baseball game with republicans vs democrats. Republicans are currently in the lead. \n",
      "I'm surprised Republicans only have 3 more wins in the baseball game, for some reason I figured they would have won moer\n",
      "Yeah, baseball does seem like a republican sport for some reason. Do you like to read?\n",
      "Yea, I never knew Churchill won a nobel prize in literature, I want to check that book out\n",
      "Sounds pretty cool. Did you know romantic kissing is fairly new and was never mention in greek literature? \n",
      "No, it's kinda odd greek literature didn't have much kissing considering how liberal they were with sex\n",
      "Yeah, kissing is kind of a weird concept though when you think about it. There is a contest where writers try to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel. I wonder what it is.\n",
      "Hmm, coming up with the worse opening line in a novel actually sounds quite challenging\n",
      "Yeah, I'm betting some of them are pretty funny. \n",
      "Well I have to go, nice chatting with you\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoy reading. How about yourself?\n",
      "Hi, I do. I was actually reading a book written by Winston Churchill, after I finished it, I realized he won a nobel prize for it!\n",
      "I just recently discovered that he won a Nobel for literature but not peace which is the opposite of what I would have thought. \n",
      "Yes. He was before my time so I only really knew about his actions as PM. Old books are interesting. In ancient greek books there are some weird romances but they rarely mention kissing for instance.\n",
      "I had also heard that. Apparently romantic kissing is a fairly recent development. I wonder why that is?\n",
      "No idea, I'm sure you can find the answer in a book. Unless it's been destroyed.\n",
      "Ugh, that's always upsetting. The FDA burned six tons of literature in the US as an act of censorship. What a waste. It makes me so angry.\n",
      "Yeah, a lot of those can never be recovered. Fortunately these days with e books it's virtually impossible to destroy literature as a digital copy will always remain.\n",
      "I certainly hope they don't find a way. Have you heard that there is a yearly contest tat challenges writers to come up with the worst opening sentence for a novel?\n",
      "I have not, but you'd think it wouldn't be too difficult to do. There are some pretty bad books out there. This is non fiction but I was just reading about boots if you can believe that. I thought it would be bad but it was interesting.\n",
      "Oh really. What was an interesting fact you came across?\n",
      "Nokia used to make boots! That's what they were known for. Given how their phones have gone lately maybe they should go back to boots.\n",
      "What?! I never would have expected that. Here's one. Do you know why Ugg boots were invented?\n",
      "Yes, that was in the book too. For surfers to keep their feet warm. You wouldn't think boots are interesting but honestly I was fascinated learning about them.\n",
      "You would think they would absorb a lot of water and become uncomfortable. They do not seem very water repellent. \n",
      "The earlier models were a lot different the the uggs of today. Before trucks farmers used to make little boots for turkeys they'd walk to markets. You would think a wagon or something like that would be more efficient. \n",
      "Ha ha, boots for turkeys. That is a hilarious image. I would love to see that. \n",
      "I just don't see how that would have been cost effective. Especially with the turkeys sold for meat once they reach their destination.\n",
      "Me either. Do you know what the phrase \"pulling oneself up by their bootstraps\" used to mean?\n",
      "No, I don't think that was mentioned in the book, but I am curious...\n",
      "It originally meant \"doing something that is pretty much impossible\". That's very interesting because it's certainly not quite how we use it now. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Serena Williams really chewed out the umpire at the last US Open Tennis Tournament.\n",
      "I heard about that it was like she had a meltdown that day or something.\n",
      "It started when she was accused of receiving coaching.\n",
      "I was really surprised at her for smashing her racket which cause her to be penalized a point it was just so unlike her.\n",
      "The umpire wasn't happy about that.\n",
      "She shouldn't have called him a \"thief\" and demanded an apology.\n",
      "Tennis fans don't take well to that.  They booed her conduct.\n",
      "Didn't they both they both get booed at the trophy presentation ceremony?\n",
      "I'm not sure why they would boo Osaka.\n",
      "I'm not sure, but she made a speech  stating to give everyone the credit where credit is due. Let's not boo anymore, and to congratulate Naomi.\n",
      "That was the right thing to do.  But the umpires are still upset at the situation.\n",
      "She really shouldn't have acted like that. It wasn't very professional.\n",
      "But people like Billy Jean King say there is a double standard, that umpires are much more tolerant of that kind of behavior from men than from women.\n",
      "I read they have threatened to boycott William's future matches\n",
      "I wonder if that will come to pass.\n",
      "The umpires believe they are being abandoned by the WTA.\n",
      "Umpire Ramos is very well respected.  Other umpires wonder if they could end up like him.\n",
      "I know they feel that no one has their back when they make unpopular calls, but they have to understand that happens in every sport.\n",
      "When you are a referee, you take guff from everyone.\n",
      "That is very true. Hopefully Williams will be smart and not to that stuff again.\n",
      "Good talking to you, enjoy the holidays.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good morning, are you a tennis fan?\n",
      "I am! I love the Williams sisters. I feel like they got a lot of flak but they're amazing\n",
      "They are two of the most dominant players ever. I think they draw a lot of unfair criticism because of how good they are.\n",
      "True. I think it also has to do with sex and race. Serena was criticized some time ago for \"having a meltdown\" in an exchange with an umpire but I've seen much, much, MUCH worse from other players and they don't get criticism about it\n",
      "That is partially true but Serena does have a habit of losing her temper on the court. I think she puts a lot of pressure on herself and can sometimes lash out when things don't go her way. I believe she once threatened a tennis judge before that incident.\n",
      "Maybe so. It must be hard being her. She was in the hospital after giving birth and had blood clots in her lungs and the doctors wouldn't listen to her until it was almost too late. She often has to \"act out\" to be heard\n",
      "I really felt bad for her opponent in that match, she had her big moment overshadowed\n",
      "That's true. Or maybe it brought her more attention? When you have a huge tennis star like Serena Williams freaking out over your move, that tells people you did pretty well...\n",
      "Usually I would say that is true but I would be curious to see how many people could name her opponent in that match versus how many just remember that there was controversy.\n",
      "Good point! I only just learned that it was Naomi Osaka, meanwhile I heard about this incident so long ago\n",
      "Hopefully for Serena's sake she can learn to express herself in tough situations like some other big time athletes in stressful situations. I don't remember Steph Curry ever having a bad moment such as this during his career. He seems to keep cool under pressure.\n",
      "I don't even know who he is. Or if he should be weighing in on this\n",
      "He's one of the best basketball players in the league today. As a contemporary black athlete and a big advocate for women in sports, I think he has a valid opinion for this.\n",
      "Speaking of Serena, she co-owns the Miami Dolphins\n",
      "I remember when the Dolphins were sold and they brought in a lot of celebrities to invest as part of the group. I believe Marc Antony and J-Lo also have part ownership of the team.\n",
      "I'd love to have enough money to invest in a sports team. Do you know if they're any good?\n",
      "The Dolphins have not been very good lately. They just brought in new coaches so maybe they can start to turn it around.\n",
      "You seem to know more about sports than me. How do they compare to the Golden State Warriors? My limited knowledge tells me that they're good lol\n",
      "The Golden State Warriors are more like the New England Patriots if you want a football comparison. Both teams are dominant and constantly in the hunt for championships.\n",
      "Wait, are the Miami Dolphins and Golden State Warriors not even teams of the same sport??\n",
      "No they are not. The Dolphins are a football team and the Warriors are a basketball team.\n",
      "I should know this stuff. I have a sibling in San Francisco, but I'm not big into basketball or football myself. Thought I do know all about the Pats and Tom Brady!\n",
      "Steph Curry is pretty much the Tom Brady of the NFL right now, he's the player you want in the big game. It was fun talking sports with you, have a great day!\n",
      "Nice talking with you, too!\n",

      "Do you know who stars in \"Sorry to Bother You\"?\n",
      "No I don't, do you?  Is that a movie?\n",
      "I heard it was Lakeith Stanfield, but am not sure.    That is a movie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh ok, I will have to check it out.  Do you know much about the US congress?\n",
      "A little.    I know there are three subway lines exclusively for congressmen to move between the capitol and offices.\n",
      "Yeah isn't that an interesting fact.  I wonder what year and why they decided to come up with that. \n",
      "It is probably a recent thing.     Certainly after the start of the annual Republican/Democrat baseball game in 1909.\n",
      "That would actually be pretty fun to watch or go back in time and watch some of those games in the early 1900's. \n",
      "I would like to see the one from 1916, when the first woman was elected to congress.\n",
      "Yeah I would like to see that as well. I would like to see how fast they pitch to each other!\n",
      "Not sure.    Did you know there is also a fantasy congress league!\n",
      "Really, I wonder how you would even score points in a league like that.  Can you imagine people getting into a fight over their fantasy congress league as well? \n",
      "Points are based off of legislative success.    I know if I were in a fight over a fantasy league, I would take off my boots!\n",
      "That is just too funny to me.  Did you know the Elmo once testified before congress?\n",
      "That is pretty funny. Does Elmo wear Ugg boots?\n",
      "That I can't tell you, but I don't know why he would have to come in or at least the character, but I think I remember when that happened actually. \n",
      "True.    I know some of the muppets would wear rubber boots like those Nokia used to make.\n",
      "Yeah I never knew that about Nokia, who would have thought.  I guess they still make them. \n",
      "I wonder if they ever made boots for Turkeys!     A quarter million turkeys used to be walked from Norfolk to London in custom boots.\n",
      "Really, I wonder why in the world that would happen!  But I guess people are really weird and do weird things for fun. \n",
      "It was probably the easiest way to transport them.    I agree, it sounds like something out of Literature.\n",
      "Yeah it does.  Well it was nice chatting with you today, I hope you have a good day. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi there, what kind of footwear do you like?\n",
      "Hello! I have a lot of boots, what about yourself?\n",
      "Yes me too, very handy for when the winter comes. Have you heard of Uggs?\n",
      "I have! I surf occasionally and they help keep my feet warm.\n",
      "Do you know how they were invented?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think in general surfers invented them to keep their feet warm after getting out of the ocean. They certainly work!\n",
      "Yeah. do you know what 'pulling oneself up by the bootstraps'means?\n",
      "I believe it's based off of doing something pretty much impossible, you really can't actually pull yourself up by bootstraps.\n",
      "Yeah, exactly. Did you know Nokia originally made boots?\n",
      "I didn't know that, do you know if they still do that?\n",
      "They still make rubber boots yes\n",
      "Boots have a lot of interesting history in general. I believe the first people to ever be photographed were a man and the cleaner cleaning his boots.\n",
      "Yes , I think that is correct. Do you like literature?\n",
      "I definitely do, I think literature is a forgotten form of art. It actually used to be an olympic event for some time.\n",
      "Yeah that is so cool, it still should be, along with music painting and sculpture\n",
      "There's still contests for it though. I know there's an annual contest that challenges writers to come up with the WORST possible opening sentence to a book.\n",
      "I would like to read those really. Did you know the FDA burned six tons of books in an act of US censorship?\n",
      "I didn't know that, that's awful. Reading has experienced a lot of changes. I heard romantic kissing is still a new development in reading.\n",
      "Yeah it seems so. In ancient greek literature it was rarely mentioned\n",
      "The state of literature has certainly improved now. Winston Churchill once won a Nobel Peace Prize for literature.\n",

      "I know a lot of people may not but I actually enjoy reading Shakespeare. How about yourself?\n",
      "The actress Olivia Wilde changed her name as a tribute to the Irish poet and playwright.  A nice tribute yes?\n",
      "A very nice tribute. I did not know that. Were you aware that Shakespeare invented many of the phrases we use today such as \"good riddance\" \"laughing stock\" \"devil incarnate\" and \"as luck would have it\"?\n",
      "Shakespeare has a large body of work that we can read.  39 plays.  I find the language a little difficult at times.  There are some hidden jokes that are clever puns.  They get lost as english changes.\n",
      "It's always hard when starting but you get caught in the rhythm pretty quickly. It's hard to believe that he was alive at the same time as Pocahontas. \n",
      "Alas, poor Pocahontas, I knew her well. I would like the idea of my skull being used in Hamlet to play Yorick.  It would be funny, but I would know nothing.\n",
      "Ha ha, Hamlet is probably my favorite Shakespeare work. I revisited it in college and loved it. I was very surprised to learn that he invented the names Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia. We use those names so much now and they seem so simple compared to most of his names. \n",
      "I wonder if we really know the man Shakespeare was?  There are few records.  We read his works and presume to know what he thought.  Few records for commoners from the day.  Unlike our lives which will have records forever.\n",
      "That's a good question. I would be interested in learning more about that. We always think of drama with Shakespeare but he also wrote comedies. Do you enjoy comedies?\n",
      "I always appreciate comedy.  Have learned that  some movies are referred to as bromantic comedies.   I dont like the name, do like the movie.  Harold and Kumar was funny.\n",
      "I like lots of those. I like Step Brothers and I Love You Man a lot. I like Demetri Martin's stand-up. He was accepted into Harvard law school but decided to do stand-up instead. He always seemed very intelligent to me. \n",
      "I do not know who Demetri Martin is.  Dropping out of school to pursue comedy is a common thing though, Ryan Stiles is a funny guy.  He was on the Drew Cary show a while ago.\n",
      "I definitely remember him. Tall, slim man. I love Bill Murray so much. Are you a fan?\n",
      "Bill Murray is the man.  Dogs and cats sleeping together.  I have never watched Kung Fu Hustle.  I need to look for that.  You know it?\n",
      "He is amazing. He is a huge fan of Kung Fu Hustle. I have seen it. It's okay but I'm going to have to disagree with him on how good it is. It's really not that great. \n",
      "I will keep that in mind.  There are many levels to comedy.  Some is pure visual, some is strictly words.  It is funny to think about the three stooges, buster keton, slapstick with and without words. \n",
      "That is true. Kung Fu Hustle is very visual and slapstick heavy. I realized that 3rd Rock From the Sun won the Golden Globe for best comedy series in 1997. That is surprising. \n",
      "3rd rock beating Seinfeld, Friends and Frasier.  Four great comedy shows airing in the same year.  Network TV was at its height.  Now things are fractured by internet channels.  Great show though.\n",
      "I did enjoy it but it certainly did not hold up as well as Seinfeld or maybe even Friends. \n",
      "I do agree that 3rd rock is not showing in reruns.  Seinfeld, Friends and even Frasier live on in reruns.  Seriously, I still see them while channel surfing.  Anyway, I have nothing to declare by my genius.   \n",
      "I definitely agree. I believe that you just quoted Oscar Wilde. Great quote. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi how are you? are you a fan of bill shakespeare?\n",
      "Yes I do like Shakespeare, even though he was born a long time ago I think he was very talented, it's crazy that he was born in 1564!\n",
      "He was alive during the time of Queen Elizabeth. I dont know how he managed to write everything he did. did he sleep? i wonder.\n",
      "Yeah he is very famous though. He's called England's national poet and sometimes even the \"Bard of Avon\" which I've never heard before\n",
      "The Bard is a nickname that I heard before. I read his stuff but it was a great experience to see it performed.\n",
      "Yes I agree, it's crazy that when his work is actually performed in a period accurate accent that the rhymes will work better\n",
      "I bet the language has changed much since his day. the language can feel impenetrable. \n",
      "Yes I agree, I didn't like reading Shakespeare as a kid but now I kind of appreciate it. And it's crazy how he would make grammatical errors in order to heighten attention to what was going on, that's very genius\n",
      "He had a genius understanding of language. the words he created just seemed to have the right sound and meaning. he changed language singlehandedly.\n",
      "Yes if only he had lived longer, I wonder what other inventions of the English language he could have made, he died at age 52 apparently\n",
      "I guess that was a pretty long life in those days. lots of disease, problems with sanitation. he could have died much younger. we are very fortunate.\n",
      "Yes I agree, on a happier note though do you ever watch any comedies? That could include black comedies as well\n",
      "I like comedies, including black comedies, and bromances too. You?\n",
      "Well I like old school stuff like Monty Python haha. And it's crazy that Graham Chapman, who was in Monty Python, was originally going to be a medical doctor but gave it up to pursue comedy\n",
      "Graham was very bright, and quite funny. unfortunately he had a serious drinking problem. i really miss him.\n",
      "Oh wow I did not know about the drinking. one station I did like a lot was comedy central, it doesn't surprise me that they canceled over 100 shows since they got started, they seem to always cancel the shows that I like\n",
      "They have not canceled South Park, thank god. I would not be able to go without that show every fall. I am addicted.\n",
      "Yep that's the only show on there that I watch now. Did you ever see the movie Green Lantern by the way? Apparently it was going to star Jack Black and I think that would have been better than Ryan Reynolds\n",
      "Yeah, Jack Black is a natural comedian. i never saw green lantern. Anyway, great chat!\n",
      "Yes you are an excellent chat partner. And make sure to check out work from Oscar Wilde, he actually did some wonderful plays\n",
      "Yes, he did the importance of being earnest. Have a good night!\n",
      "Thank you too! And it's interesting that he has relatives like his great-grandson who is actually a computer programmer these days\n",

      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "I'm good, did you know that tom hanks is the highest total grossing box-office draw for an actor\n",
      "He deserves it! He's america's sweetheart!\n",
      "haah that is true, the guy literally refuses to play the roles of bad guys\n",
      "Did you ever see him in Boosum Buddies? It was one of his first gigs and it was a sitcom.\n",
      "haha no I've never seen that, I do like him in forrest gump and apollo 13 though\n",
      "Yeah. He has like a 5 year run of just great movies. I loved cast away. \n",
      "ya that's a good one too, have you ever seen the movie Saving Mr Banks\n",
      "I do not think so. What was it about?\n",
      "I don't know but tom hanks played walt disney in that movie apparently, I've never seen it myself\n",
      "I do remember seeing the trailer for that but never saw it. I never saw Sully either.\n",
      "sully is kind of boring in my opinion, one cool thing about tom hanks is he always ends his emails with a pun\n",
      "That's fun. I wish I had a thing... I didn't see Sully because I didn't like that they insinuated that he did it on purpose. I was offended by it.\n",
      "ya, plus if you know what happened in real life, it kind of takes the drama out of the movie, I guess Tom Hanks personally refunded money for one of his movies when a crowd said they didn't like it haha, nice guy\n",
      "He's so much nice than I would have been. Not sure I would have sent them money. Proably would have been something more immature.\n",
      "haha nope I would have just left haha, do you like disney movies what is your favorite one?\n",
      "I love disney. Aladin is my favorite.\n",
      "I like the Little Mermaid myself! but yes I guess Disney thought about shutting down after the failure of sleeping beauty\n",
      "I loved the little mermaid. I watch it all the time with my daughter. It is getting a little old, it's one of those movies kids always want to watch.\n",
      "ya I think the songs in that one are some of Disney's best, have you seen the disney movie treasure planet\n",
      "I have not. I will check it out. Nice chatting with you!\n",

      "I have. I loved him in Black Panther. Have you heard of him?\n",
      "He showed up on SNL. He was on the Black Jeopardy skit. Hilarious!\n",
      "I never saw that one. Do you watch SNL a lot?\n",
      "I watched Black Jeopardy on YouTube. The character Black Panther is supposed to have half a trillion in wealth.\n",
      "HA! Im going to look it up. Did you ever see the sean conery jeopardy skit?\n",
      "Yes, he kept mispronouncing the categories like The Pen is Mightier. Very funny. I didn't know that the Black Panther character was not named after the political party\n",
      "The black panther is the richest super hero worth about $500B... \n",
      "He comes from a prosperous country. Chadwick Boseman needed financial help when he was young though.\n",
      "I read that. Didn't someone famous pay for his acting classes?\n",
      "Yeah, Denzel paid for his study at Oxford in the summer.\n",
      "That was really nice. You never hear about that type of altruism in pop culture. Usually just the bad stuff. That's really nice.\n",
      "Denzel did it secretly, so I think he really wanted to help. Did you know that Tom Hanks refuses to play bad guys? I think he would be a fun bad guy.\n",
      "Everyone would be so down on him. He seems to be a legit good person. Do you like his movies?\n",
      "I like his films geneally. I think that he has good range. He can do comedy and drama. I think it's cheesy that he ends his emails with a pun. That's totally a dad move.\n",
      "I like his films. He had a run of a few really films. Castaway was one of them.\n",
      "His films have generated 8.5 billion $$ worldwide. Hanks is a bankable star. Disney should put him in Star Wars.\n",
      "I saw that they just released the last jedi on Netflix. I am so excited to watch it. DO you like star wars?\n",
      "I liked the first three films. I think there are too many films and it's difficult to keep track of things. I dunno. Maybe I'm old.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hi, did you see black panther?\n",
      "No, unfortunately I have not. Have you?\n",
      "I did. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought it was a good addition to the Marvel Universe.\n",
      "Did you know that the richest superhero is actually black panther?\n",
      "I did read something about that. I thought it was Tony Stark, but alas, not.\n",
      "He is estimated at $500 billion! Do you know Tony Starks worth?\n",
      "I am not sure. Do you know how much?\n",
      "I believe it is $100 billion and bruce wayne is a little less then that.\n",
      "I wonder if they are doing ok. $100B doesn't go as far as it used too!\n",
      "I would be able to make it work haha Bruce wayne's estimation is $80 billion. \n",
      "That's gotta be one cold bat cave with only $80B! Do you think tom hanks would have made a good batman?\n",
      "I really like his voice but not sure if he would make a good batman. What are your thoughts.\n",
      "Nothing scares me less than Tom Hanks. I would run into his loving arms if I saw him in a dark ally!\n",
      "HAHAHH I love that. Did you know that he refuses to play bad guy roles in films. \n",
      "See, just a great guy! Plus he makes such good movies. They have made over $8.5B!\n",
      "I know, that makes him the highest all-time box office star.\n",
      "His role in Saving Mr Banks is the first time someone has played Disney in a mainstream film? That's weird!\n",
      "I wonder why no one has played walt disney before?\n",
      "I know... i would have thought it was played in a movie before then. But it's Tom Hanks and he can do anything!\n",
      "Very true. Do you know how he ends his emails?\n",
      "No, how?\n",
      "With puns! I am going to go look into funny puns. Have a nice day. \n",

      "Hi. I am a huge fan of movies. I really liked Black Panther. Have you seen it?\n",
      "Yes, it was great.  I hope there is a sequel\n",
      "Oh, that would be cool! It broke $1 billion dollars on the box office! I have heard it a bona fide global sensation. \n",
      "I love all the super hero movies but Black Panther might be my favorite.  Did you know Dorothy Steel made her film debut in this movie? and she is 91!\n",
      "No way, I had no idea! That is a pretty neat thing to get off a bucket list at 91 yrs old. I heard that the richest superhero is the Black Panther, who is estimated $500 billion. Bruce Wayne is only at $80 million and been around a lot longer.\n",
      "That is impressive!  Are you a Tom Hanks fan?\n",
      "Yes, he cracks me up! I like that he refuses to play bad guys in the movies he chooses.\n",
      "Yeah, he has been in so many great movies.  I really like Big and The Green Mile. Do you have a favorite?\n",
      "That is true. He has so many great movies but I really loved Mr. Banks. That was his more recent film and the first actor to play Walt Disney in a mainstream film.\n",
      "I haven't seen that one yet.  How is Walt Disney portrayed in that movie?\n",
      "It was a very nice feel good movie with a historical feel. Tom Hanks has over $8.5 billion in worldwide film earnings. He is actually the highest all-time box office star.\n",
      "I would think he would be.  He has been in the so many great high grossing movies.  I have seen most of his movies and the only one i did not like was Turner and Hooch.\n",
      "Yeah, good point and that was a long time ago. You never know what movie will be a hit. For instance The movie Trojan Wars only grossed $309 but had a budget of 15 billion\n",
      "It is hard to predict what will be a hit.  I heard Tom Hanks was originally cast as Mario in a super Mario movie.  I don't think that would have been good for his career.\n",
      "HA, oh funny and I agree with you. Disney has also had some hits and flops. The Disney movie Treasure PLanet was the most expensive flop of all times for them. I never saw it though.\n",
      "I don't even remember Treasure Planet and my wife loves Disney movies and makes me watch them.\n",
      "That says a lot huh! I really loved Beauty and The Beast but I heard it was  huge failure and they almost closed down the animation portion because of it.\n",
      "Beauty and the Beast is my wife's favorite.  Mine is Lion King.  Do you have a favorite Disney movie?\n",
      "Yeah, mine is Beauty and the Beast, I force everyone to watch it about twice a year at my house. As far as Tom Hanks goes, I really want to watch Apollo 13 again. I haven't seen it since it came out in 1995.\n",
      "For Tom Hanks, I would probably say The Green Mile (I am a huge fan of Stephen King books which that movie is based)\n",
      "Oh, yeah that was super weird and cool. It was a Stephen King scary movie made very cool by Tom Hanks. Thanks for the fun chatting, I am gonna have a movie day now.\n",
      "Sounds good, nice chatting with you\n",

      "Hi there, do you like Spiderman?\n",
      "I do, he's one of my favorite superheros.\n",
      "He has a hyphen because Stan Lee didn't want him confused with Superman. I guess I wrote it wrong. Should be Spider-man.\n",
      "That's pretty interesting, Stan Lee was an amazing man. Did you know that in 1998 Marvel offered the cinematic rights to all of it's characters to Sony for a mere $25 Million?\n",
      "Yeah and Sony rejected it and only bought the rights to Spider-man!\n",
      "That's crazy, but I think they both did well on the deal.\n",
      "Do you know Madame Web? Stan Lee's wife did her voice in the 94 Spider-man series.\n",
      "I didn't know that. Did you know the Broadway Musical \"Spider-Man: Turn off the Dark\" is the most expensive production in Broadway history?\n",
      "Seems like the music would be good. Too bad there were too many injuries on set, so that they had to shut down because they couldn't get injury insurance anymore.\n",
      "Yeah the music and lyrics were written by Bono wasn't it?\n",
      "Yeah, I heard that. Superheroes cause a lot of damage in their universe. There was a comic series about fixing their collateral damage.\n",
      "That's pretty cool. Did you know there is actually a superhero called \"Normalman?\"\n",
      "What can he do?\n",
      "Basically nothing, he was the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes.\n",
      "Wow, I'd be nervous if I were him. In real life there are also 300 registered superheroes. Wonder whatis needed to register.\n",
      "I'm not sure, that does seem like alot.\n",
      "My kids like this Garfield book series spinoff, called Pet force. Garfield and the gang are superheros. Have you heard of it?\n",
      "I have not, it sounds pretty funny. I'll have to check it out!\n",
      "I am in the mood to watch a Marvel show on Netflix. See you!\n",
      "I think I will do the same!\n",

      "Hi, how are you? I like music, too. What genre do you like? Jazz?\n",
      "I do like Jazz, what about you?\n",
      "Jazz is great! There are some fans out there I would not have suspected, like Clint Eastwood, a lifelong jazz enthusiast,\n",
      "Yeah, I think I saw him play the piano in several films some of them had Jazz songs.\n",
      "Clint is great! He is not much of a singer though. On a related note, I’m astonished that Pakistan has a jazz orchestra. I did not imagine jazz as popular in that part of the world. \n",
      "Pakistan has an orchestra? that is an interesting fact indeed, do you know why trumpeters grew goatees?\n",
      "Jazz trumpeters grew goatees because they provide comfort when playing. I guess clarinet players don't need it. Then again Steven Spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack and he has facial hair.\n",
      "He did? thats a cool fact, I didnt know he was behind that scary soundtrack, did you watch the movie Tron?\n",
      "No, I never saw the movie Tron. \n",
      "I see well if you ever see it pay attention to the soundtrack, Daft Punk is the band that plays it.\n",
      "Did you know Ed Sheeran? He says that Eminem is one of his biggest musical influences. I don't really know Eminem. Ed has a better vocal range than Freddie Mercury, and that's saying something.\n",
      "Really? no wonder why his voice is so good, you know he recorded the song I see Fire for the Hobbit movie in barely a day\n",
      "I wonder how many other soundtracks he's been on. Ed wrote the song \"Love Yourself\" but thought it wouldn't fit his album, so he gave it to Bieber. That's a strange choice. Why Bieber, and not another singer?\n",
      "Maybe they are friends or he owed Bieber a favor or maybe theres something else going on only the two of them know, but it does seem weird\n",
      "Ed certainly had a rough start to his career. After he finished his  music course, he couch surfed for 2.5 f years, slept  outside Buckingham Palace and slept on the Underground. \n",
      "Wow he sure had it tough, many artists seem to fight a lot to get to the top, I bet he sang on buses and public transportation, people didnt know he was going to become as big of an artist as he is now\n",
      "I should learn more about his music. I know he's got tons of cash now. I wonder what kind of compositions Ed would come up with in the programming language in which the programs are written in musical composition.\n",
      "Yeah one of his biggest influences was Eminem, I guess he wouldnt be the same without the influence of that other great artist.\n",
      "Well, I enjoyed chatting!\n",
      "Be sure to listen to some of  Ed Sheeran songs lol, have a nice day.\n",

      "Hello, yes, I like them alot!\n",
      "I've never been good at distinguishing between Marvel and DC, since I dont know too much, but Ive always liked Hulk, but I think my favorite is Deadpool.\n",
      "Yes, I like the Hulk Didn't know there were over 300 registered superheroes in the US!\n",
      "Wow that is a lot.  I heard there is a comic about fixing the collateral damage caused by the superheros.  I bet that is a funny one.\n",
      "I was thinking the same. lol, Have you seen the Normalman superhero?\n",
      "No.  what is his power or lack there of?\n",
      "On the planet of superheroes, only one without!\n",
      "Ha.  That would be interesting to see.  Did you know Cap'n Crunch has rivals?\n",
      "I saw that, who knew? I have a Garfield cat, I would love the see Pet Force and watch Garfield and the gang!\n",
      "Ahh.  Garfield.  I loved those cartoons.  Odie, Nermal.  That would be great!\n",
      "So cute! So Stan Lee needed that hyphen in Spider-man so there was't any confusion.\n",
      "There is even a marvel superhero with hearing aids!  They created one because a little boy believed superheros dont wear them so they created them.\n",
      "Awww,I love that! That will be a great one for the kids!\n",
      "I think that is great that they help out the world like that. \n",
      "So agree. Stan Lee's wife Joan was the voice of madame web in the Spider-man series.\n",
      "That is neat.  Marvel even argued in court that mutants arent people so they got to pay lower rates on toys.\n",
      "Really, surprised. Walt Disney World acquired Marvel Entertainment, but doesn't have the rights  the Big,X-men and Toys.\n",
      "I didnt know Disney acquired them.  That is pretty neat.  It is like Disney owns everything\n",
      "lol, I know, Disney and Universal go back and forth, its crazy! Great chat!!\n",
      "Have a great day.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello! Are you a spider-man fan. \n",
      "I'm not big into superheroes, but he's pretty cool. They made a Spider-Man musical and it was the most expensive Broadway show, ever!\n",
      "That is crazy. I heard that it was 75 million. I wonder what made it that high. \n",
      "Those are some expensive spider webs! Marvel sold Spider-Man to Sony in 1998. They offered to sell the other characters, but Sony declined. \n",
      "I was surprised by that. I learned that it was because they believed that movie audiences would only care about him. Which is probably true. \n",
      "I don't know, seems to be a ton of superhero movies out lately! Hard to believe Marvel started under another name way back in 1939!\n",
      "It is crazy to think that there are over 300 registered superheroes in the united states. I wonder how many come from marvel. \n",
      "Probably a lot. I know they have Hulk, Thor, Deadpool, and Iron Man just to name a few. \n",
      "I think one of the funniest superhero's I heard about is normalman. He is the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes. \n",
      "That's pretty funny. Disney owns Marvel now which is a neat collaboration. \n",
      "They are also great for the community. Marvel created a superhero to help a boy feel more comfortable about his hearing aids. \n",
      "I heard about that! He was called Blue Ear. So cool!\n",
      "The boy told his mom superheroes dont wear hearing aids so marvel created one. That is so inspiring \n",
      "He was only 4 years old! I'm sure he loved it!\n",
      "It is bizarre that disney cannot show big marvel characters in theme parks. \n",
      "Yeah, they have some old agreement with Universal about that. \n",
      "Yes, back in the 90s they signed. \n",
      "No Avengers at Disney World, I guess!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, also they went to court to say that mutants are not people. \n",
      "So they could get cheaper rate on the toys the sell. Not a bad idea! Thanks for chatting!\n",

      "Hi good afternoon! Do you like Spiderman? Like other Marvel characters he was created by Stan Lee.\n",
      "Hi! Yes! I love all the superhero movies! Stan lee was so creative an amazing he did such great work within the Marvel Company\n",
      "Awesome! Spiderman first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing fantasy number 15.\n",
      "Wow, I didnt know, I did know that Stan Lee wrote 15 dc comics! isnt it incredible?!\n",
      "Yes that is very incredible. The wife of Stan Lee was the voice of Madame Web in the 1994 Spiderman series.\n",
      "Oh cool! Speaking of spiderman, apparently sony bought the rights for 10 mill but they only wanted spiderman and rejected the offer to buy all for 25 mill... i wonder if they regret it now\n",
      "Yes I bet Sony wished they could buy the rest of the characters right now. But at least they have Spiderman.\n",
      "Yes, it feels like it was just yesterday but this was back in 1998 so im sure they are worth way more now. \n",
      "Oh yes and no doubt. Actually the most expensive production in Broadway history was the Broadway musical Spiderman: turn off the dark.\n",
      "interesting, I can see how people can relate or want to be a superhero in real life. Did you know there are over 300 registered superheroes in the US.\n",
      "Well I am definitely not one of them LOL. There's actually comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes. Have you heard of that?\n",
      "lol, no I've never heard of that although there is a super hero named \"normalman\" the only person without super powers...i can relate haha\n",
      "I can definitely relate as well. There's even a comic book about Garfield and the gang.\n",
      "I loved garfield and i heard about that I think it was called \"pet force\"\n",
      "Yes I think it was. Surprising to hear that the superhero fiction genre has been around since the 1930s.\n",
      "yes, its awesome to see the evolution and growth from Marvel finally branding to Marvel from Atlas comics in 1961...its inspiring. gives me hope\n",
      "Yes it really is. I just really like the Marvel brand. There's one character owned by both Marvel and DC named access.\n",
      "and so sweet! Did you know they created a super hero for a 4 year old boy who was uncomfortable wearing his hearing aids!!! melts my heart!\n",
      "That is so cute. The superheroes name was blue ear! Well it was great chatting with you today I hope you have a good one.\n",
      "Yes! because the boy told his mom superheroes dont wear hearing aids! awww... so much fun chatting with you too! Sending love and light to you! take care!!\n",
      "Have a good day bye!\n",

      "You heard of the electronic music group The Thievery Corporation? theyre starting to blow up apparently\n",
      "I head they devoloped a greatdoundtrack for a big weeding in Cheve Chase Md.\n",
      "Yes they did. I think they're going to be very famous in the future. What kind of music do you listen to do you like jazz?\n",
      "I like Jazz music, yeah, I like  the Pakistan jazz orchestra, really talented group\n",
      "I'll have to listen to that. I do like Clint Eastwood movies and I always like the scores in his movies, apparently he wrote some of the jazz music for them\n",
      "He has? so he not only is a great actor but also a talented musician?\n",
      "Yes exactly. I wonder if he ever performed at that woman's house in Harlem? She puts on a jazz concert every weekend in her apartment\n",
      "That amazing, I bet her neighbors really liked that, I know I would\n",
      "I would like it as long as it's not too late LOL. I would want to be able to sleep if I had you. I'm a programmer too and I didn't realize that there is a programming language that will make a jazz Melody if all of the conditions are met correctly\n",
      "You are a programmer, thats amazing, and yeah it  seems like Jazz inspires many people and also things \n",
      "Yes jazz is a great thing I think. If I ever learn the trumpet I would grow a goatee though, people use that to make it more comfortable when playing apparently\n",
      "Ive always wondered about those goatees, they look a bit rediculous but its nice to know they have a purpose\n",
      "Yes I agree! What movie has your favorite soundtrack by the way? I always like the Jaws theme myself\n",
      "I like the soundtrack from Batman Begins, but the soundtrack from Jaws still gives me the creeps\n",
      "It's funny in the soundtrack for Jaws though, apparently Steven Spielberg plays the clarinet LOL\n",
      "He does? that is funny, so the claninet from the movie was Spielberg, I guess he is a man with many talents\n",
      "Yes he is! Have you seen the movie O Brother Where Art Thou? It has great soundtrack 2, it was certified 8 times Platinum\n",
      "No, havent seen that movie, the soundtrack must be great to be certified platinum 8 times\n",
      "Yeah the soundtrack is really good. Also you mentioned the soundtrack to Batman Begins, each name on the soundtrack is actually the name of a genus of bat which is interesting\n",
      "I never paid attention to that, another talented artist is Ed Sheeran do you like his music¡\n",
      "No I haven't listened to his music much. apparently Eminem is a big influence on him though, I do like Eminem\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jazz originated from New Orleans in the late 19th century.\n",
      "It developed from roots in blues and ragtime music, that was a little surprising to me.\n",
      "It came into it's own in the 1920's, being seen as a major form of music.\n",
      "Towards the end of the 1940's a more calmer, smoother sound was introduced.\n",
      "What became known as \"cool jazz\".  I think I definitely prefer the after 1940's sound.\n",
      "I like the sound of Ed Sheeran's music, surprised to see that he wrote \"love yourself\"\n",
      "I'm not familiar with him, he's so young, born in 1991!\n",
      "He has quite the workload, being singer, songwriter, guitarist, record producer and actor!\n",
      "People have such varied talents, Steven Spielberg actually plays the clarinet in the Jaws soundtrack.\n",
      "That is impressive! Just like Phil Collins recording versions of the tarzan soundtrack in italian, german, spanish and french.\n",
      "I barely mastered English!  Speaking of music there is a Harlem woman who has hosted jazz concerts every Sunday for free. \n",
      "Wow that sounds fun, I wonder if any big names have taken part in that.\n",
      "Elite performers do stop by, I don't think any jazz musician can truly be considered a big name, they're just not well known.\n",
      "I couldn't name a jazz musician. Jazz trumpeters are known to grow goatees, for comfort while playing.\n",
      "That's so weird, I wonder why.  \n",
      "I have no experience, but maybe something to do with where the instrument hits around the mouth?\n",
      "It's as strange as a Pakistani jazz orchestra!\n",
      "Apparently they're topping the charts, who would have known!\n",
      "The soundtrack to O Brother, Where Art Thou? smashed the charts, going eight times platinum!\n",
      "Impressive, I have never heard any of that soundtrack\n",
      "I bet we have and just didn't know it was from that.  \n",
      "That is very possible\n",
      "Good chat! Thanks!\n",

      "I find the universe to be utterly fascinating. How about yourself?\n",
      "Of course, the universe covers many secrets. I'm very eager to know about it.\n",
      "It definitely does. There are scientists who theorize that universes evolve through natural selection much like different species do on earth. So that would mean some weaker aspects die off in favor of stronger ones? That's very interesting. \n",
      "Yes, Universal Darwinism refers to a variety of approaches that extend the theory of Darwinism beyond its original domain of biological evolution on Earth.\n",
      "I never thought that could apply to the universe as a whole. A lot of theories are hard to wrap your head around. Like the theair that the universe may be one giant hologram!\n",
      "I think typically, a hologram is a photographic recording of a light field, rather than of an image formed by a lens.\n",
      "Yes it just seems like an unbelievable theory in this case. There is another theory that there is only one electron in the entire universe. How is that remotely possible?\n",
      "I don't know about that details. But it was very interesting. \n",
      "Well all atoms are made of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Atoms are the building blocks of everything and each one contains electrons so how could one theorize that there is only one electron in the universe? \n",
      "Yes, When the electron is moving backwards in time, it's a positron, the anti-matter counterpart of the electron.\n",
      "Whoa. Interesting. Here's another surprising one. There are stars in the universe that are cold enough to be touched by the human hand. Given that our sun is a star and we know how hot that is, that's a shocking fact as well. \n",
      "Okay that's nice. Do you like any superhero? \n",
      "I don't have a favorite but there are several that I like. How about yourself?\n",
      " Such talented actors are the superheroes too.\n",
      "Yes most of the superhero movies now feature very talented actors. Were you aware that there are over 300 registered superheroes in the united states?\n",
      "I think Spiderman. Batman. Costumes. Crazy. Hero. Hollywood. Powers. Is it right?\n",
      "Those are all very successful superheroes that have movie franchises yes. A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine. I always liked Storm and Psylocke from X-Men and I also really like the Jessica Jones Alias book and the Netflix show. \n",
      "Yes, These people are mindful of people.\n",
      "Psylocke and Jessica Jones are very conflicted characters and I like that they are more complex. I'm less of a fan of good only characters like Superman. But all superheroes cause a lot of damage and there was actually once a comic series  about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes.\n",
      "Superman is a fictional superhero, me also like superman.\n",
      "Yes he is. I'm not a big fan of his. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good morning! Isn't the universe a crazy thing. The spatial size of the entire universe isn't even known.\n",
      "it blows my mind to think about it! We truly are just so tiny in comparison to everything else\n",
      "You're so right. The earliest scientific models of the universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers. Very ahead of their time.\n",
      "wow. There's also a theory that there's only one electron in the universe. that sounds kind of wild to me\n",
      "Yes that is a bit out of the deep end for me too. There is a region of space and maybe pulling galaxies outside the observable universe. I can't even fathom that\n",
      "I can't fathom much about the universe, it is all so over my head (literally)\n",
      "Ha ha good one. Another odd theory is that the universe may be one giant super hologram.\n",
      "isn't that a theory that Elon Musk has been talking about recently? That we're all living in some sort of simulation?\n",
      "I actually haven't heard that theory. I have heard that there are stars in the known universe that are cold enough to be touched by human hand.\n",
      "wow, that would be quite the experience, touching a star. I wonder if anyone has done it before\n",
      "I agree I would love to do that. Not sure if it's been done before. I wonder if the universe evolves through natural selection like species on earth do?\n",
      "I'm thinking probably not, since there is not intervention from other species and it doesnt seem like much changes up there aside from sciencey stuff. But what do I know!\n",
      "Yeah true that's a good point. I am just glad we know as much as we do now much thanks to past philosophers like Newton and Cpernicus! \n",
      "me too. Did you know there are over 300 registered Superheroes in the United States?\n",
      "I never knew that. Kind of funny there's one named normal man.\n",
      "I would like to actually read a comic with him in it sometime, that would be an interesting take!\n",
      "Yes that would be Interesting for a change as well. There was a Garfield book series spinoff named pet force which feature Garfield and gang as superheroes.\n",
      "that sounds awesome. Move aside, Avengers, Garfield is in town!\n",
      "Ha ha for real. Stan Lee once wrote 15 DC comics, reimagining popular superheroes like Batman and Superman. I would like to see those.\n",
      "I wonder if he did that during Marvel's time as being huge or before he was all in with Marvel\n",
      "Yeah I'm not sure good question. There is even a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes. It was very nice talking with you today.\n",
      "yes you too!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "do you like the Batman movie?\n",
      "Yes I do. Did you know that Superman gave Batman a kryptonite ring once?\n",
      "As a gift? Did you hear there was a villain named condiment king?\n",
      "Hmm I have not but Superman gave him the ring in case he ever went rogue and needed to be stopped\n",
      "WOw good thinking. The condiment king was defeated by slipping on his own ketchup\n",
      "WOw what? Did you know Keaton refused to play Batman in Batman Forever even for $15 million?\n",
      "Wow that is amazing. West has a batman logo in his molar\n",
      "Nice. The growl of Batman was Nolan's fault not Bale's\n",
      "Nice. Do you know where Gotham City is located?\n",
      "Hmm I believe it is New York , is it not?\n",
      "Actually according to DC Canon it is in New Jersey\n",
      "Oh cool. Do you like comic books?\n",
      "I do. Do you know how Stan Lee finished his calls ?\n",
      "Hmm I am not sure, what is it?\n",
      "It was always with the word Excelsior\n",
      "Cool. Did you know Marvel had to spend 10 years to convince the government that X-men are not human?\n",
      "Wow crazy. The Marvel cinematic universes takes place in earth - 199999\n",
      "Cool. Do you know how the word brainiac came about?\n",
      "Hmm I am not sure, how? DO you know what DC stands for ?\n",
      "Hmm I am not sure, how? The word Brainiac came from DC for the supervillain in superman\n",
      "Oh cool. DC stands for Detective Comics\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "do you like literature?\n",
      "I love it. Did you know the FDA once burned tons of books?\n",
      "Yes that is sad and a pitty but it was because of censorship\n",
      "Yes. Churchill once won the nobel litarature prize\n",
      "Yeah. There is a literature contest where the worst opening sentence wins\n",
      "Haha that must have been a fun one I bet\n",
      "Yeah. Did you know literature was an Olympic sport?\n",
      "Yeah along with sculpture, painting, music and others until 1952\n",
      "Yeah. Romantic kissing was also pretty absent in ancient literature\n",
      "Yeah. Do you have a favorite shirt?\n",
      "I like the polos. DO you know how they were invented?\n",
      "Yes it was all the idea of a tennis player Rene Lacoste\n",
      "Yeah and then other polo players adopted that\n",
      "Yeah. Do you know what the business attire is in Hawaii?\n",
      "Yes that is the aloha shirt, so cool\n",
      "I knowwww and comfy too. We should have something here like that\n",
      "I agree. Do you know where the button down is?\n",
      "Yes that is the collar tips fasten to the body of the shirt. ANd button down?\n",
      "Button down is when they do not fasten to the shirt\n",
      "Yes Do you know what the pallbeares wore at Billy May;s funeral?\n",
      "Yes they wore blue shirt and khaki pants\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Talking about sexual harassment, Ted Koppel victim-blamed, saying that if women wear short skirts it's their fault. \n",
      "It doesn't matter what a woman wears, someone is going to get attention.\n",
      "Wanted and unwanted attention!  They sometimes get catcalls while jogging in sweat pants.\n",
      "I don't know much about Koppel. I know lots of men in the news biz have been busted for sexist and harassing behavior.\n",
      "He is 78, so from the \"old school\".  So I wonder if he excuses behavior that is not acceptable today.\n",
      "That sort of behavior is not needed in the workplace, which is where we get work done. Did you know that the t-shirt was invented in 1904 and marketed to bachelors who couldn't sew or replace buttons?\n",
      "That t-shirt fact makes sense.  I have worked a bit in Hawaii where the aloha shirt is business attire even back in the day when a suit and tie was more common on the mainland.\n",
      "I like that Levi's jeans helped create casual Fridays in workplaces all over the world. Same spirit as the aloha spirit in Hawaii. \n",
      "True.  I now live in Phoenix.  I think we adopted less formal dress pretty fast because of the heat.  Clothing sends messages.  In China, layered shirts used to mean gang fashion.\n",
      "That's a smart move in a place like Phoenix. Do you all wear jeans in that heat? I'll take note of that Chinese fashion guideline.\n",
      "Shorts are pretty common.  I go to a Baptist church and only wear long pants about 8 weeks in December and January.   There are lots of jeans this time of year.  Ladies wear the skin tight.\n",
      "What?! Skin tight jeans! Ted Koppel would say those are just like short skirts! LOL.\n",
      "Perhaps!  Did you know that the small pocket in jeans was designed for pocket watches?\n",
      "Usually kids use those to put their boogers in. They call it their \"booger bank.\" It's funny that blue jeans are outlawed in North Korea because they are a symbol of American imperialism. I'm an imperialist!\"\n",
      "I never heard that about the watch pocket and I hope I can erase it from my mind!  Levi did a great marketing move by making a denim tuxedo for Bing Crosby when he was turned away from a hotel for wearing jeans.\n",
      "Jeans are totally wholesome! A student wore the same pair of jeans for 15 months. That student lived, as did everyone in his school!\n",
      "Surely there was some washing in the 15 months.  We called them blue jeans when I was in school and I loved the new Levi's at the start of each year.  Now the premium jeans are made to look worn when they are new.\n",
      "Didn't wash them! The same amount of germs as at 13 days of wear. I think jeans might be the safest clothes to wear.\n",
      "Wow!  I would think the smell would be awful.  Perhaps he was totally inactive and did not sweat.  There are about half a dozen jeans brands co-owned by Wrangler.\n",
      "Never worn the Wrangler. Usually Levi's. They don't cheat like Old Navy, which markets jeans with a 41\" waist as 36\"\n",
      "I did not know that.  I have had nerve damage from my metal watch band being too tight when lifting things, so I can understand how skinny jeans could cause nerve damage.  Nice talk!  \n",

      "hi how are you? Do you like superheroes?\n",
      "I do love superheroes!  Do you have a favorite one?\n",
      "i dont know much about superheroes. i did like a couple of the spider-man movies.\n",
      "They were good.  There are plenty of superheroes to pick from as there are over 300 of them registered in the United States.\n",
      "I wonder how one goes about registering a superhero. could i make up a hero and get it registered?\n",
      "I'm thinking you could.  Kind of like when a musician writes a song and gets it registered.  I'm sure it's the same thing with graphic designs, ideas, etc.  I think the funniest superhero ever is Normalman.  He was the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes. LOL\n",
      "i wonder who came up with that character. what does that character do all day? I guess it could be an interesting setting for strange stories.\n",
      "It almost sounds like that they came up with that character after struggling to come up with a new superhero with special super powers.  I think they were digging the bottom of the barrel with normalman.  lol\n",
      "Yeah, the superpowers get a bit stale. the backstories start to sound the same. i dont watch superhero films because it seems to be all special fx.\n",
      "You're right there.  Even Garfield had a superhero spinoff series named Pet Force.\n",
      "I think they are getting desperate for content. i guess if the story is good, then i would watch it. but explosions are just not interesting to me.\n",
      "The graphics seem to me to be too fake looking now and even the digital enhanced landscapes don't look real. \n",
      "for an older audience, the characters and plot need to be developed. i liked the second spider-man for that reason. the comic book film for people that dont read comic books.\n",
      "Speaking of spider-man and comic books.  Sad that Stan Lee passed away recently.  He used to end every phone conversation he had with the word \"excelsior!\"\n",
      "he lived to age 95. a good long life. he made a million a year just for staying alive. LOL. \n",
      "LOL  Did you ever hear of manga comics?  By 1995 the manga market in Japan was valued at $6 to $7 billion dollars. Holy cow!  That was like 15 years before it exploded here in the states.\n",
      "yeah, the comic industry is big there. not much money for the people at the bottom. long hours, low pay but many many fans.\n",
      "I didn't know that.  Did you know that DC from DC comics stands for detective comics?\n",
      "Yeah, i heard that. detective comics comics. What?! Very creative there. Anyway, great chat!\n",
      "I had a good time learning about these comic books.  Next time I'm driving by the Michigan State University library I'm going to have to stop in and browse their comic book collection which is the largest in the world! LOL  Have a great night!\n",

      "I am a big fan of literature and reading is one of my hobbies. Do you enjoy books?\n",
      "it's a funny thing.  i used to read a lot but these days i spend more time listening to music but i have been thinking about getting back into the reading.  who are some of your fav authors?\n",
      "I enjoy Orwell, Vonnegut, Ira Levin, Stephen King. That's to name a few. Apparently at one point the FDA burned 6 tons of literature in an act of censorship. I find that very depressing. \n",
      "i read almost every one of Vonnegut's books a few years ago.  i even read his very earliest works before he became so famous.  definitely a unique talent.\n",
      "I love the way he writes. It's somehow simple and profound at the same time. It's so insightful without ever feeling pretentious. I don't know how he did it. He made the complex simple. \n",
      "perfectly stated.  there are times it's almost like reading a book for children.  yet he is incredibly profound.  is he still alive?\n",
      "No unfortunately he fell off a ladder in his older age and passed away. I actually chose to decorate my living room in framed book quotes and he has the most spots. i know that Fahrenheit 451 was banned in schools several times.  \n",
      "i read so many of his books in such a short period of time that they all sort of run together.  remind me about Farenheit 451.\n",
      "Fahrenheit 451 is about Billy Pilgrim who was a soldier and POW when he was young and an optometrist later in life. He becomes unstuck in time and life becomes non-linear.  \n",
      "it is vague to me but i sort of recall reading it.  and of course \"breakfast of champions.\"  going back to your remark about the fda burning tons of literature, yes it is depressing.  \n",
      "I apologize so much. I realized as soon as I typed it that my titles are switched. I was still thinking about burning books as a form of censorship which is the plot of Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury. The Vonnegut book we were discussing is Slaughterhouse-Five. Again, so sorry. \n",
      "no problem.  i have heard of bradbury; not very familiar with him.  yes slaughterhouse-five a fabulous book i remember discussing it with someone a few years ago.  great.\n",
      "It is a fantastic book. I do recommend Fahrenheit 451 as well. I am often amazed about the books that have been censored. I really can't think of a valid reason to have banned Slaughterhouse-Five. I don't agree with censoring books at all, but even for teenagers that seems like a fine book for them to read. Shakespeare has more mature themes than that.\n",
      "was slaughter-house five about concentration camps? i clearly remember at least one of his books had very dark overtones but valuable to read.\n",
      "Not really. He was a POW in a camp but he was treated well. Unfortunately it was in Dresden and he was there when it was bombed and the casualties were extremely high. Several of his books get very dark. Cat's Cradle is a good example of things becoming very dark. That's the one where they develop Ice 9 which freezes water instantly.  \n",
      "okay it's all coming back now.  my memory isn't as good as it used to be.  when i think of censorship the first book i think about is \"catcher in the rye\" which fortunately was NOT censored in my high school.  45 years later and i clearly remember reading that book.  it was so different than anything i had read before.\n",
      "That is another one that I do not understand banning. Meanwhile they had us read Hamlet where everyone either kills themselves or is murdered. It is very confusing how they made these decisions. \n",
      "the only thing i can think of with \"catcher\" is there some sexual scenes and i think that in some cases any type of sexual stuff is sort of considered off limits.  and of course those were different times.  i read \"catcher\" in the early 1970s.\n",
      "I believe many were banned in the 70's. They seemed to be a bit of a hysteria at some point in there. \n",
      "yes.  perhaps it might have been the after effects of the '60s.  censorship is a very judgemental type of thing.  groups of people thinking they know best what people can read.  absurd.\n",
      "I very much agree. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Theres a lot of controversy going on with anti sexual harrasnemt activist and Ted Koppel\n",
      "Ted Koppel? The news guy? Has he been sexually harassed? Or what?\n",
      "No, there was just controversy about it, his just old fashioned, he is a 78 year old man\n",
      "He is old fashioned about sexual harassment. I guess there is an old way to do it and a new way. He should probably do it the new way. \n",
      "I agree, he should do it the new way, so you like to read? do you like literature?\n",
      "Yes, I do. You?\n",
      "Yeah, I think its unfair how the FDA burnes 6 tons of books\n",
      "That sounds like the Nazis! I wonder why they did that. Isn't it illegal in the US?\n",
      "I guess at the time it wasnt and that does sound like a Nazi thing, censoring info from people, \n",
      "It's all done to protect the naive, the ignorant and the innocent from themselves. I should be thankful to the FDA. \n",
      "Books and information are powerfull tools and can be dangerous in the wrong hands\n",
      "I should say so! Put them in the hands of the FDA and they disappear! How often do you wear shirts? \n",
      "Almost everyday, what about you? do you wear them often?\n",
      "Shirts can be comfortable in public situations where people are apt to wear clothing. I find shirts constraining in other places. I guess I wear them enough to say that it is a habit. I don't know that I could break the habit at this point.\n",
      "Yeah it seems like shirts are here to stay, I like to wear Polo shirts, really comfortable\n",
      "I do not play polo, so I can't say that I have much call for the shirt. But I understand that among the elite, there is a call for such wear.\n",
      "Well the shirt was invented by tennis players actually, and its used in tennis as well\n",
      "Oh, they should call it a tennisso shirt or something, not a pollo shirt. \"Pollo\" means chicken in spanish by the way. That's a strange name for a shirt.\n",
      "It is a strange name I agree with you there, just like in China they have this strage culrural revolution gang\n",
      "The word \"China\" in \"Chinese\" means strange, so I am not surprised by anything that that country makes, including chicken shirts. \n",
      "Some countries have strage traditions we might seems strange to them though\n",

      "Hello. Do you like superheroes?\n",
      "I do like superheroes. Do you?\n",
      "Yes I do.  They've been around in comic books and movies since the 1930s.\n",
      "Have you seen the show \"Titans\"? I know DC has a channel but I have not seen it.\n",
      "No I haven't seen it.  Is it from the cartoon teenage titans or something like that?\n",
      "I think so. It sounds like it picks up Robin right after he leaves Batman. Sounds interesting. Would you watch it?\n",
      "I think I would. I would like to see what happens to Robin later in life.\n",
      "Me too. My son watches Teen Titans all the time. I try to turn it off since he is 7 but he likes it and I am not that worried about it, yet.\n",
      "I wonder if in the show they have robin become more of a superhero in his own right, instead of just a sidekick.\n",
      "I think so. I have read a lot about the DC channel/website. I think it sounds really interesting with old Batman shows on it too.\n",
      "Yeah Batman has been around for a really long time.  i think he got started back in 1939.\n",
      "Did you ever watch those old adam west shows? I am too young to have seen them but I used to watch the reruns when I was younger, like 20 years later.\n",
      "i've seen some of the reruns too.  Did you know he had the batman logo put on one of his teeth?\n",
      "I had no idea. How would you like to slip and get caught on your own super power, like condiment king.\n",
      "Condiment King?  What kind of power did he have that he slipped on?\n",
      "He shot ketchup and slipped on his own ketchup. Batman then caught him. Seems like limited creativity back then.\n",
      "It really does lol!  Batman wasn't given any superpowers by the writers which is odd considering his enemies had them.\n",
      "That is true! I always knew about Batman's powers but not his villains. According to DC canon, New Jersey is home to Gotham City.\n",
      "Really?  I always thought it would be New York.\n",
      "Me too! I never knew the joker and batman don't use first names with each other.\n",
      "When i think about the movies and tv show I don't remember them ever calling each other anything other than their character names.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey there have you seen the TV show The Flash?\n",
      "I have actually, and I like it. Did you know he rusn so fast that he outran death itself?\n",
      "LOL I didn't know that. No I've never actually seen the show. I do know someone told me that it was good though. Do you think I should watch it\n",
      "I think so, at least give it a try. Yeah he outran death by running past entropy and into the next universe\n",
      "That's pretty cool. I guess the main character's name is Allen? And he uses his super speed to fight criminals\n",
      "Yes. He was travelled back in time even\n",
      "Yes and I guess that this show is a spin-off of the show Arrow? That show before? Also this show started back in 2014. I wonder how many seasons there are\n",
      "Likely 5 seasons by now. The guy who plays his dad on the show used to play the Flash himself \n",
      "Oh that's a cool throwback. I guess a bolt of lightning gave the Flash's powers in the first place? How did that happen exactly haha\n",
      "He was hit by a lightning and then woke up with a bunch of powers like outrunning death\n",
      "I guess death is called the black flash? You can also outrun space and time? One cool thing is that I like Deadpool, and a person from Deadpool does Gideons voice in The Flash\n",
      "Nice, there seems to be so much overlap. Wonder what the collateral damage these guys cause is\n",
      "Haha I wonder that too. What do you know about the universe? Pretty crazy that at one point people thought the Earth was the center of it\n",
      "Right? SO much new stuff. SOme think that the universe is one giant hologram\n",
      "I heard that theory. I also heard a theory that there is only one electron in the whole universe. I have no idea how either of those would work though haha\n",
      "Yeah me too. Another one says that universes evolve like we do\n",
      "That is interesting. I want to visit a star that is cold enough to be touched by the human hand. I guess that does exist somewhere\n",
      "And it is believed that there is a region that is pulling galaxies outside of the observable universe\n",
      "That is crazy! Do you like any superheroes by the way? I guess they started out in the 1930s\n",
      "I think my favorite is the classic, Superman, How about you?\n",
      "I like Batman a lot myself. But the rest of the superheroes I like are all in the Marvel Universe. For some reason there are 300 registered superheroes in the United States.\n",

      "Candice Patton didn't realize what starring on the Flash would mean playing a role that had been previously played by a white woman before.  \n",
      "It's surprising that people were upset with it in this modern day and age.\n",
      "That's really a shame she got people acting like that.\n",
      "Apparently it wasn't a lot but there was a subset of people that didn't want to see her in the role.\n",
      "Change always is difficult for people.\n",
      "That is very true. But apparently The Flash has become one fo the network's most popoular superhero shows.\n",
      "The show is terrific.  People have accepted the change now and its set in stone as Patton adds\n",
      "I haven't actually watched it. I am not really into superhero shows though I did like Jessica Jones. I will have to check it out.\n",
      "Scheduling is hard with superhero shows says Patton and they do skip some sleep.\n",
      "If you were the Flash you wouldn't have to worry about that. The flash can outrun and defeat death by outracing it to the end of time and space. Seems pretty convenient.\n",
      "Yes, he is fast! The actors though don't know how they would have time to film a movie too because they spend time shooting 23 episodes a year.\n",
      "Yes, Patton doesn't know how they do it every year, but apparently they do make it a successful show.\n",
      "Morena Baccarin from deadpool is gideon's voice in flash\n",
      "That is interesting. How the flash came to be is kind of confusing. He became a pure energy in the past and that's what gave him his powers in the first place.\n",
      "Yes, sometimes just best to go with it.  Did you know there are 300 registered superheroes in the US?\n",
      "That sure is a lot. Who is your favorite superhero?\n",
      "I personally like spiderman and the flash\n",
      "Have you heard of normalman? He actually was the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes.\n",
      "No that sounds interesting.  Marvel creator Lee wrote 15 comics for dc\n",

      "Have you ever watch the TV show Archer? It's on FXX\n",
      "I have seen a few episodes, but I haven't actually watched a whole season. Is it good?\n",
      "I heard it's really good. I guess they used to name their corporation Isis until Isis became a thing in real life\n",
      "That's pretty interesting. I believe it takes place in 1939 and premiered in 2010.\n",
      "Yep you're right, they actually use different genres for each season apparently for instance they use a 1940s Noir genre in one season and then the next one they'll do a comedic 1970s Hollywood Thriller genre\n",
      "Wow, I didn't know that. I'm a little more intrigued to watch it now. Do you watch anime at all?\n",
      "Do you like to watch anime. one of my favorites is the anime Akira, what about you\n",
      "I like all the Studio Ghibli movies. Did you know they have a powerpuff girls show in Japan called powerpuff z?\n",
      "Wow I didn't know that. Do you like Cowboy Bebop? That was the first anime they ever put on the television network Adult Swim\n",
      "I have seen a few episodes here and there. I probably saw them on Adult swim now that I think about it. Have you watched Pokemon?\n",
      "Yes I love Pokemon! Don't they have almost 800 episodes by now?\n",
      "I'm not sure, but I love it too. Spent a lot of my youth watching/playing Pokemon. Mewtwo strikes back was supposed to be the series finale.\n",
      "Oh I never knew that. I was really good at Pokemon back in the day haha.\n",
      "lol! John Cena is also a fan of anime. I never would have guessed that.\n",
      "No I wouldn't have thought that either, do you like scientists by the way? Do you know any\n",
      "My cousin just recently started her career as a scientist. It seems pretty awesome. Did you know Harrison Schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon? I would have thought there would have been more.\n",
      "Yep I would have thought that too, it's also cool that the emperor of Japan is a scientist and publishes papers\n",
      "That is really cool. I think a lot of people in positions of power should be more knowledgeable in certain fields like science.\n",
      "Yep I agree, what do you think about scientist John Von Neumann though? he was so smart that at age 6 he could divide two eight digit numbers in his head\n",
      "That is totally crazy. He must have been seriously talented to preform math like that. He could also converse in ancient Greek!\n",
      "Yes he sounds like a genius! Also Geniuses are the Harvard scientists that put a gif animation of a galloping horse somehow into the DNA of some bacteria LOL that poor bacteria\n",

      "Not really, do you? I am a fan of comedy though!\n",
      "A couple movies, but not so much else. I like comedy too! Ryan Stiles dropped out of high school to pursue comedy.\n",
      "He made a wise choice! Demetri Martin kind of did the same thing, but he was at Harvard at the time!\n",
      "Wow, that's a pretty risky choice! Do you like the genre of bromantic comedies?\n",
      "I do actually but probably because I'm a guy and can relate lol. How about you?\n",
      "I'm not a guy, but I do still enjoy them! The hangover and pineapple express are some good ones!\n",
      "They really are! Bill Murray is by far my favorite comedic actor!\n",
      "He's pretty funny. One of my favorite actors is Seth Rogen! \n",
      "Another funny man! I wonder if anybody would have been awesome in slapstick comedies back in the day?\n",
      "Maybe! Did you ever watch Pokemon growing up?\n",
      "I did! I was going crazy when they brought out the Pokemon movie with mewtwo in it! you?\n",
      "Absolutely! Very fond memories of it growing up! Mewtwo strikes back was supposed to be the series finale. \n",
      "I wonder how well that went? I think there's been like 750 episodes lol. Have you seen powerpuff girls?\n",
      "Yeah, i'm pretty sure it's never going to burn out at this point! I have, I used to love it!\n",
      "Me too. Sugar, spice, and everything nice! hahaha. The actual japanese anime for that was called powerpuff girls z.\n",
      "That's interesting! I wonder how different they were. John Cena is a fan of anime, that's a little surprising! \n",
      "His favorite anime is called Fist of the North Star! Interesting indeed lol.\n",
      "Just goes to show, you can never really tell! Daft punk apparently released an anime movie. Have you seen it? \n",

      "Hey do you ever browse reddit? It's basically an American social news aggregation. \n",
      "Sometimes, although I dont spend too much time there\n",
      "Yes I find it interesting sometimes. In February of 2018 it had 542 million monthly visitors!\n",
      "That is a lot!  It was the third most visited site!\n",
      "That is impressive. Despite the traffic and popularity only 0.53% of the people who visit vote on the content.\n",
      "I wonder why that is?\n",
      "Not sure. The first ever comment on reddit was actually a complaint. Kind of ironic lol. \n",
      "Wasnt it about Reddit going downhill?  \n",
      "Yes I believe it was! People of reddit are passionate no doubt. They once made an online magazine called the redditor!\n",
      "Is it like a compilation of the big things around reddit?\n",
      "Good question I actually don;t know. I like looking at funny animal pictures on reddit. Did you know there are 20 quintillion animals on earth?!\n",
      "And the ones in Germany even have some rights!\n",
      "Haha that's kind of cool. Looks like they did that back in 2002!\n",
      "I think that is one place where you cant \"own\" a dog.  You can live with one you take care of.\n",
      "Interesting. Scotland took it one step forward and protected the mythical Loch Ness monster!\n",
      "Well, you dont want a dead Nessie on your hands!\n",
      "Very true! Did you ever play tetris growing up? It was actually designed by a Russian programmer.\n",
      "It was one of my favorite games!    How about you?\n",
      "Yes it is so addicting! It is one of the best selling video games of all time! So nice chatting with you this evening!\n",

      "Hi! I do use Reddit to read about stuff, but I fall under the percentage where only .53% of people who visit actually participate in voting for content. Do you use Reddit?\n",
      "I use it sometimes. And another page sums up the best deeds people have done. How nice\n",
      "What do you are the kind of deeds that people do to be added to something on that page?\n",
      "I have no idea but I am assuming it is something that stands out. Do you know who invented Reddit?\n",
      "I don't know who invented Reddit, I think it's because of the scandals surrounding facebook that I don't hear much about Reddit probably. Do you know?\n",
      "Yeah that is a good point. THere were two people and one of them is Alexis Onahan\n",
      "I've never heard of that guy/gal, is there another company they're know to have be affiliated with besides Reddit?\n",
      "I am not sure but I do not that he is married to the tennis legend Serena Williams\n",
      "Oh really?! I wonder if Williams invested in the company early on as a result. Where did that name come from anyway, Reddit, do you know?\n",
      "I am not sure of that actually. But Alexis was the first person to post on it\n",
      "There's quite a few interesting threads about animals, one of them being that animals who are domesticated develop a white patch on their foreheads, I never noticed that.\n",
      "Me neither I have a dog and have not seen it. Do you know why we have hiccups?\n",
      "I have not seen it on my pets either, why do we have hiccups?\n",
      "Well they are a holdover for when animals had lungs and gills\n",
      "Oh wow, so does that mean animals have the hiccups as well?\n",
      "I guess so. In Germany , the constitution now protects the animals. How cool is that?\n",
      "That is pretty neat, but last I checked, wasn't Bratwurst a big thing in Germany? So are animals truly protected?\n",
      "I think they are protected against abuse, like dogs and such. Even Losh Ness Monster is a protected species\n",
      "Oh ok, I see. Do you know if the US has anything like that where animals are also protected from abuse and such? I have no idea what Losh Ness Monsters are but they sound frightening.\n",
      "I do not think so. Loch Ness Monster is actually a mythical creature so I am not sure how you protect them.\n",

      "No, but I do read it all the time. \n",
      "I like how it is organized by subjects\n",
      "Me too. I actually read it almost everyday. \n",
      "542 million visitors!\n",
      "Wholly Molly! That is a lot. What do you think about animals?\n",
      "I love animals.  Almost all 7 million!\n",
      "That is pretty cool. Did you know animals develop white patches on their head when they are domesticated? \n",
      "Neat.  They also have dominant paws!\n",
      "I didn't know that. Did you know the Loch Ness monster is a protected species? \n",
      "Yes my dog is right pawed haha.  Neat about Loch Ness\n",

      "How's it going, any interest in Marvel Comic? They started production in 1939\n",
      "Wow, that is a long time.  I do like some stuff, but I am not a fanatic or anything.\n",
      "I use to read a little when I was a kid but enjoy all the movies since Disney bought Marvel in 2009\n",
      "Which was a good move for them, they also own Star Wars which is a huge franchise!\n",
      "Yea, the funny thing is Sony had a chance to buy the film rights to all Marvel characters for 25 million but only bought Spiderman\n",
      "Wow, what an oversight. \n",
      "Yep, Sony just paid 10 million for spiderman because they though no one would care about the other characters\n",
      "There is one character that both Marvel and DC own, who has the job of keeping the universes separate!\n",
      "Yea, Access, I wonder if Disney and Warner Bros will come together to make a movie on him\n",
      "That would be pretty cool.  Disney doesnt own the rights to the big characters.\n",
      "Yea, it's a shame that Disney world won't be able to have spiderman or Avengers rides due to Universal Studios contract.\n",
      "Yeah, I wonder if there was a time limit on that contract?  Id love for Disney to create superhero land!\n",
      "Hopefully, they could always make an attraction with their Superhero Blue Ear who wears a hearing aid\n",
      "I heard about him.  He was created to help a little boy who told his mom that superheroes dont wear hearing aids.  \n",
      "Yep. So have you seen any of the new Star Wars movies? I prefer the original trilogy that came out between 1977 and 1983\n",
      "The original trilogy are THE star wars movies!  The rest is just ok.  I mean Jar Jar Binks?  Really?\n",
      "Yea, too bad Marcia Lucas wasn't around when Lucas came up with that like she was for the original Star Wars\n",
      "She played a bigger role in the movies than people realize.  I am glad she won the academy award for editing!\n",
      "Yea, she probably was able to convince George Lucas not to make Han Solo a large green alien\n",
      "That would have made things pretty bad.  Im glad she did what she did!\n",

      "\n",
      "One of my favorite villains is the Joker, do you like him?\n",
      "I do like him, and especially Harley Quinn!\n",
      "Yeah Harley Quinn is a badass and also really hot. Did you watch the movie Suicide Squad?\n",
      "I watched it once with my daughter. It was surprisingly funny!\n",
      "I thought it was great, some of the special effects were too much for me but the cast was good I didnt like Jared Leto as the Joker though. \n",
      "Who do you think should have played him? I think casting parts would be extremely difficult to make sure you appeal the masses and are successful with the movie.\n",
      "I have no idea, its a hard role to play Heath Ledger was my favorite Joker, too bad he passed away, he would have been a great choice for the movie. \n",
      "OH yes! He played that part perfectly!! Marvel Comics has a lot of good superhero movies. Have you seen the new Spiderman?\n",
      "I have seen that movie, the latest ones or the old ones?\n",
      "I just watch the latest one. It was surprisingly good! I'm a bigger Disney fan than Marvel Comics though. \n",
      "Well Marvel is now owned by Disney so that kills to birds with one stone, Sony had the chance to buy all of Marvel superheroes once and at a really low price. \n",
      "Wow! Sony must really be regretting that decision! I heard Disney bought Marvel but doesn't own the rights to feature the \"big\" marvel characters in theme parks east of the Mississippi. I wonder if they can in Disney Land in California.\n",
      "Yeah I bet they are Disney also owns Star Wars, it seems like they are buying all mayor franchises. \n",
      "I would if I were them too. If they take the major entertainment companies over, they basically secure their place in the entertainment world.\n",
      "Yeah those are smart moves, do you also like the Star Wars franchise?\n",
      "I love the Star Wars franchise! I have all the movies and watch them frequently with the kids. Did you know Al Pacino originally turned down the part of Han Solo?!\n",
      "Really? good thing he didnt get the part, why did he turned down the role? I bet he regretted that later\n",
      "I can't picture him as Han Solo. lol. He turned down the part because he couldn't understand the script! lol\n",
      "That is funny and also a mayor mistake on his part, it is the most successful film merchandising franchise, he could be even more famous. \n",
      "I know right! When it comes to movie roles, i bet there are a lot of regrets.\n",
      "Yeah he could be Han Solo its been great chatting with you by the way. \n",
      "You too! Have a great day!\n",

      "\n",

      "Did you know that astronauts in space can't whistle?\n",
      "No, I had no clue. I wonder if that has anything to do with the weightlessness. The apollo 13 cast could only do 25 second takes when filming in nasa's zero-gravity plane\n",
      "I don't know but that is interesting to consider.  Astronauts are pretty lucky, not just for getting to go out into space but general motors used to give a free corvette to them when they got back to earth.\n",
      "Yea that is lucky but their is some risk, moon dust can cut through spacesuit material and is bad for health\n",
      "It can cut through spacesuit material?  Wow.  I personally wish everyone could travel in space.  There is so much to see and learn about.  I mean, there's a water vapor cloud in space that has 100 trillion times more water than all of the water on earth.\n",
      "That's crazy! Japan was able to take a rock sample off an asteroid and return it back to earth\n",
      "I wonder what they learned from the rock sample.  There is a lot to be learned here on earth too though.  Only 1.5 million of the estimated 7 million animal species are known and described.\n",
      "Yea and over a million of them are insects, that's nuts\n",
      "Who knows what's all out there.  We might even discover the actual loch ness monster.  It's been a protected species in Scotland since 1912.\n",
      "Lol I wonder if he was represented by the lawyer in Switzerland whose clients are animals\n",
      "i've heard about that lawyer lol!  I wonder what kind of cases he does.  You know though, things are getting weird as far as animals are concerned.  Germany has granted them rights afforded in their constitution.\n",
      "Well animals from different geographically areas communicate with each other in different languages/dialects unique to that area\n",
      "It does sound as if they are more advanced as species than originally thought doesn't it?  Perhaps we are more alike with them than we think.  We do hiccup and that is supposedly a hold over from back when some animals hand lungs and gills.\n",
      "Well some animals are a lot different, their are some lobsters and jellyfish that are biologically immortal\n",
      "That sounds interesting.  Science has given animals a kingdom called Animalia.\n",
      "Yea animals are cool. Do you like the Thor movies? It was the fourth film in the MCU and one of my favorites\n",
      "I do like Thor. I especially like the well known actors that were in it, such as Anthony Hopkins.\n",
      "Yes Hopkins was good as Odin and Tom Hiddleston was an excellent casting choice for Loki\n",
      "They both were perfect.  Did you know Hiddleston tried out for the role of Thor?\n",
      "Yea I read that, glad Hiddleston ended up getting cast as Loki though\n",
      "Me too.  I've heard that the cast improvised some of the ragnarok language.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed the movie Thor, I can't believe Loki gained 50 pounds of muscle to only later be turned down for the role of Thor!\n",
      "That is amazing. He is the perfect cast for Loki though. I can't imagine anyone else playing him. \n",
      "Yes! He did a great job! The language they spoke \"Taika Waiti\" was actually improvised, I think I would bust out in laughter making gibberish sounds.\n",
      "I can't believe we saw the infinity gauntlet way back then and no one picked up on it. \n",
      "Yeah! I sure didn't. But what was the infinity gauntlet again?\n",
      "It is the gauntlet thanos used to destroy half of all life in the universe. But it is the wrong hand in Thor so they think it might have not been the real one. \n",
      "Oh! Thanks for clarifying! I was a little confused by that statement. Really surprised that there is an animal called the \"loch ness monster\"! I think the name sounds a little frightening.\n",
      "I would love to know what it really is. There is theories that it a dinosaur. \n",
      "Me too! But it sounds so grand and gigantic! I was watching Jurassic Park the other day and wonder if the existence of 20 quintillion animals is still accurate, given how dinosaurs grew extinct.\n",
      "I think there are so many animals in the rain forest we don't even know about yet. I would love to study zoology. \n",
      "That's very true, do you love animals? The intricate food webs and food chains is very interesting and at the same time alarming.\n",
      "I do love animals. Growing up in the country you get to see the food chains first hand. Especially the roles some of those 1 million insects can play. \n",
      "Oh wow!  I've recently started raising some chickens and I'm still amazed by eggs coming from an actual animal! You must've seen much more detailed events!\n",
      "It is amazing to see. I'm not sure about the theory that domesticated animals develop patches on their head though because that is seen in while horses too. \n",
      "Yeah, I rarely ever see that but an interesting fact to learn about. I've always been excited about space exploration. It's pretty funny to learn about the restrictions of astronauts due to gravity, like they can't whistle in a spacesuit.\n",
      "That is a neat fact. I wonder if there is a way to harnass the water vapor that is in space to help eliminate drought on earth. \n",
      "That'll be really neat, maybe scientists are studying it. I wish the same effect could be applied to thunder, if we could harness the electricity from one thunder strike, it would be enough to power the entire earth for at least five minutes!\n",
      "The earth is an amazing creation. I wonder what the practical applications could be of the drop pods to deploy anywhere on earth. It could have humanitarian impacts. \n",
      "Agreed. There should be courses around the concept of space offered in schools!\n",
      "I think it would be awesome to offer a stem class in the mechanics of space engineering. There are so many intricate things that people don't even know. \n",
      "Yeah, when I was in school, there was only computer science being offered, but I hope that there are more of STEM classes as well in middle school/high school rather than in college.\n",
      "There does seem to be a push for STEM activites in younger people which is great. Practical applications always are necessary to learn. \n",
      "Yeah, I think movies like Thor sparks creativity in children, I highly encourage teens to watch Marvel movies and read the comics.\n",
      "Creativity gives us a new lens on the world. I think all scientists need more creativity in their life if we are going to think of out of the box solutions to the worlds problems. \n",
      "Yes, I know I get completely absorbed in those movies and think about the universe and the life on other planets as well.\n",
      "I think the creativity allows us to access the right/left brain connections that aren't always used in everyday life. \n",
      "Yeah, even when trying to improvise a dialogue in thor, that seems stimulating as well haha\n",
      "The way they tie these films together like with the gauntlet and the ravens is amazing. It shows high levels of a creative spirit. \n",
      "Yes and it flows perfectly too, I wonder if they layout the foundation with how many phases to tell the story or what\n",
      "They would almost have to. Otherwise the details would get muddled and the bloggers would have a field day picking the movies apart. \n",
      "haha, so far I've been very impresssed!\n",
      "It's hard not to be. They have poured a lot of money into Marvel Studios. It shows in the quality of work though. \n",
      "Disney's purchase of Marvel was a great fit, in my opinion. \n",
      "It was definately a smart money move on their part. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello,  How are you?  Have you watched Thor? The infinity gauntlet is shown briefly during thor (the movie), but its authenticity is disputed because it's right-handed (it's left-handed in comics)\n",
      "Thor is one of my favorite marvel movies. The casting of Chris Hemsworth as Thor was a great job.\n",
      "Absolutely!  Perfect role for him. Tom hiddleston, who plays loki in the avengers, screen tested for the role of thor. he went on a strict diet and gained 50 pounds of muscle. they later decided he would be better for the role of loki.\n",
      "I never knew he gained that much muscle. That's crazy but Hiddleston is a great loki\n",
      "Yeah,  I know right!  Ant man made his marvel debut before spider-man, hulk, thor and iron-man.\n",
      "Hmm I didn't know that. Did you know Hugin and munin appear in the Avenger's film?\n",
      "No I didn't but since I didn't know them before this,  I wasn't looking for any birds. According to taika waititi, 80% of the dialogue in thor: ragnarok was improvised, in order to create a \"very loose and collaborate mood\" among the cast an attempt to replicate the tone and sensibility from his previous films.\n",
      "Nice, they did a great job improvising the scenes\n",
      "Yeah they did.  Did you know There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth.\n",
      "That's crazy, there's only like 7 million species of animals on earth\n",
      "only?  That sounds like a lot. Animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated.\n",
      "That's cool, did you know the loch ness monster is a protected species in Scotland?\n",
      "I did,  thats freaking awesome! In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights.\n",
      "Does that include the ones the size of  8.5 millionths of a metre?\n",
      "I have no clue lol it didn't give me any more detail. \n",
      "That's crazy, there's 1 million species of insects, I wonder if fly swatters are illegal in Germany\n",
      "haha probably not. Hiccups are a holdover from early evolution when early land animals had both gills and lungs.\n",
      "Wow, I never knew that. Did you know there is a water vapor cloud in space with 100 trillion times the amount of water on earth?\n",
      "No,  thats amazing. General motors used to give the mercury and apollo series astronauts a free corvette when they returned from space.\n",
      "Nice, the USMC are researching using drop pods from space\n",
      "Awesome,  great talking to you! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey, how are you doing? Are you a fan of Thor the movie?\n",
      "No.  But I have heard about it.  My son is a fan.\n",
      "Do you watch any superhero movies? Marvel Comics have had some great movies as of late, usually produced by Marvel Studios\n",
      "I like superman and batman movies.\n",
      "What do you like about them the most compared to other characters? \n",
      "I like them because they defeated evil beings.  I watched them when I was young.  How about you, who is your fav superhero?\n",
      "I'm not really sure who my favorite super hero is, they all have flaws but they are all good overall. I think if more people acted like superheros, we'd realize the world would get on a lot better. That's just my opinion though. Are you a big fan of space? \n",
      "What space (fiction or non fiction?)  I just read an article.  I felt sorry for Tom Hiddleston who prepared himself to be Thor.\n",
      "Non-fiction, real life outer space, it's just amazing to think about and hurts my head to think that far into it to be honest. \n",
      "I see.  Apparently, astronauts in a spacesuit cannot whistle.  \n",
      "I've heard that, did you see the USMC is trying to develop drop pods to deploy anywhere on earth from outerspace? That's nuts!\n",
      "I heard about it.  I wonder who was funding the project.\n",
      "Not sure, I'm sure NASA is a huge help though, but funding is constantly being cut from NASA so I'm not sure. I wonder how far space really goes.\n",
      "It will be nice to continue space programs if we have funding.  By the way, GM used to give free corvettes to Apollo and mercury astronauts when they returned to earth.\n",
      "That's pretty cool, I often think about how an astronaut feels, I wonder how life changing it is to see the earth from afar\n",
      "Some of them wrote books about their experiences.  Apparently, if astronauts out on a space walk wants to talk in private, they will touch helmets.\n",
      "Wow, neat! It's so nuts to think about the water vapor cloud in the space that is 100 trillion times the amount of water on earth, fascinating.\n",
      "That is fascinating. Space related facts often fascinate me.\n",
      "The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance for understanding the physical universe, it's just so crazy to think about. For example, do ants realize humans are around? If we're like ants in the bigger picture, do we notice that aliens are around us?\n",
      "I am sure that they are other beings out there but perhaps they are far away. Disagreements continues between philosophers about our universe.\n",
      "True, I guess we'll never know. It was great talking with you though, have a good one!\n",
      "It was nice chatting with you too.\n",
      "You as well, I hope you have a good rest of the evening, I'll try not to think about the depths of space that much !\n",
      "I will read more about the space.  Have a nice evening.  Bye.\n",
      "You as well, take care and enjoy the rest of the week!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Hey there!  Did you see the movie \"Gotti\" with John Travolta? I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't.  It apparently was failure among many critics.\n",
      "I did not but the reviews did pan it.  The reviews on Rotten Tomatoes were not that horrible though\n",
      "Hmmm... thought I saw that it got a zero percent on Rotten Tomatoes.  Do you use Rotten Tomatoes much?\n",
      "It had a 71 percent score on there with an abnormally high number of ratings - like it was faked?  I do use rotten tomatoes to get ideas on what movies to see\n",
      "Interesting.  Yeah, I had also see an ad by the people who made Gotti comparing the critics to trolls.  Guess audience vs. critics scores were widely different.  (Or perhaps faked as you say.)  Do you read the audience score or the critics scores?\n",
      "I read both.  I tend to believe the critics scores a bit more, but I am pretty easy-going on movie choices so I do look at the audience scores.\n",
      "Did you see Incredibles 2?  I think it opened the same weekend as Gotti.\n",
      "I have not seen it but I have heard it was a great animated flick by Pixar.\n",
      "I loved it.  My favorite character is Edna Mode.  Was sure the character was voiced by some old lady.  Come to find out the character was voiced by the director Brad Bird.\n",
      "And I love Samuel Jackson - I understand he played frozone in that movie.\n",
      "Yeah, love Samuel L Jackson.  One of my favorites.  He's always a big box office draw.  Though I heard Tom Hanks may be this highest all-time box office star.\n",
      "I love Tom Hanks.  I found it curious how the Lord of the Rings movies had huge losses despite being a success\n",
      "Wow, that's pretty surprising.  Never know what's going to bring in the money huh?  You know you'd figure anything Disney would be a sure hit but heard that their animated \"Treasure Planet\" was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time.\n",
      "Yes.  And John Carter was a flop over here but broke box office records in Russia\n",
      "And I loved John Carter.  Never know, never know.  I don't like Michael Bay movies.  His rotten tomatoes average film rating is something like 38% but his movies are always blockbusters.\n",
      "And Ashton Kutcher has never had a single movie with a fresh rating!\n",
      "And his movies are generally success too right?  Makes you wonder how it all works.  Not that the rotten tomatoes ratings always matter but saw that Netflix has almost 150 movies available with a 100% rating.\n",
      "You must think that there are fake reviews for anything with a 100 percent rating.\n",
      "Yeah, kinds brings us back to Gotti.  I'm mean the director, Kevin Connolly is pretty well liked. So some of those rating could've been faked\n",
      "Yes especially since it had a horrible 5.1 rating on IMDB\n",
      "Ha! That's the same rating as \"Police Academy 4!\"\n",
      "Yes!  The original Police Academy was good but they went downhill fast!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "good afternoon, how you doing today?\n",
      "i'm great! have you heard of the new movie gotti?\n",
      "oh good lord yes I have, a whopping 0% on rotten tomatoes!\n",
      "i know can you believe it! john travolta is usually great\n",
      "its getting completely slammed by critics too. the marketing company claimed audiences loved it, but i find that hard to believe\n",
      "well not just audiences, it mentions gotti's son gave it a 7 out of 10\n",
      "that man is biased, no way he actually liked it\n",
      "it eludes to the fact that there could be fake reviews on rotten tomatoes. do you think that's true?\n",
      "I dont think so. there could defintiely be some people trolling, but the tomato score is just generated by aggregating reviews form top critics around the internet\n",
      "yeah, and given the fact that it sits at 0, it must be painful. would you watch it?\n",
      "I might just for morbid curiosity. its a trainwreck, so it could be funny\n",
      "i hate to admit it, but sometimes i like terrible movies. AND i used to watch the gotti family reality show years ago on VH1. So, this might just be up my alley lol\n",
      "if you like terrible movies,a ccoridng to rotton tomatoes most of Michael Bays stuff is pretty bad. hie films average a 38%\n",
      "haha! I don't even know who he is! Also, what does a \"fresh rating\" on rotten tomatoes mean?\n",
      "a fresh rating is something that has 70% or more I believe. Just means that its widely considered to be a good movie. which no video game movies have, the highest one in that category is only 44%\n",
      "oh wow. and apparently ashton kutcher's movies aren't that great either!\n",
      "really? what does he average?\n",
      "it doesn't list his average, it just says he hasn't been in a single movie with a fresh rating\n",
      "oh man, thats sad for him. I like his movies usually\n",
      "i don't recall too many of his movies, i've seen a couple and they are alright. i did like him in that 70s show!\n",
      "that show wasn't my cup of tea, but I enjoy him when hes on Shark Tank\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you see the latest John Gotti Movie with John Travolta? \n",
      "I haven't seen it yet, but I am excited for it despite it getting a 0% rating on rotten tomatoes.\n",
      "I like Travolta but this has been done so many times already. The best version I've seen is with Armand Assante\n",
      "True that it has been done so many times already, but I don't think that the harsh assessments of the critics were rather harsh\n",
      "Yeah most times i ignore them as the audience usually right. It's owned by Warner brothers so there you go, ha ha\n",
      "I mean some even said it was the worst mob movie of all time. Also you are right, the marketing team for Gotti did a good job turning the situation around to gather a greater following.\n",
      "Netflix has about 150 movies with a score of 100% on RT.\n",
      "I wonder how good those 150 movies are. I have to say though that most of the time, Rotten Tomatoes does a very good job of rating its movies, much better than imdb.\n",
      "Hey you remember Siskel & Ebert? \n",
      "Is that a movie?\n",
      "No they we're the original rotten tomatoes. they use to come on tv Sundays i think an actually review movies with clips it was pretty cool. \n",
      "Oh! I have never heard of or used Siskel & Ebert before. I used rotten tomatoes ever since I saw spykids after seeing that it had a 93% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes\n",
      "13 years before the sequel there was a video game called the incredibles raise of the underminer. \n",
      "It is too bad that no film based on video games have gotten above 44%. Speaking of incredibles raise of the underminer, have you seen the incredibles?\n",
      "I saw the first one, i enjoyed it...Funny!! It's set in the 60's a pretty good time period.\n",
      "I also enjoyed incredibles 2 created by walt disney. Most sequels don't do very well, but disney did a good job.\n",
      "I did not see the second one but im sure your right.  Apparently Disney thought about closing their animation studio because Sleeping Beauty did so bad. \n",
      "Well its weird that Sleeping Beauty did so bad considering how iconic it is today. Although I'm sure their experience with treasure planet in the box office sure didn't help\n",
      "Ha ha! You know it's all about the mighty dollar. I didn't realize that Tom Hanks is the highest movie earnings of all time. 8.5 million. is that from toy story you think?\n",
      "I mean he is a star capable of carrying the whole movie by himself to an amazing degree. It is better to pay a good actor rather than flop like trojan wars The movie with a budge of 15million only earned 309 dollars in box office\n",
      "That's one i never got to see either, doge a bullet you say, ha ha! Now Silence of the lamb on the other hand with Anthony Hopkins was a hit. 270 million. \n",
      "I have to concur. In any case, this was a wonderful opportunity to chat about movies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey! Have you heard about that \"Gotti\" movie? 0% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n",
      "I never understood the Rotten Tomatoes rating. I guess having a higher rating is good. I didn't know it was ratings from critics. \n",
      "Yes, it's the percent of critics who recommend the film. No critics have recommended it so far.\n",
      "Surely, someone somewhere has to like it. Supposedly, the fan ratings are fake. \n",
      "They say that it's being well received by audiences. What do you make of that? Marketing? Or are the critics wrong?\n",
      "I think it could be a little of both. Sometimes, fans want to prove the critics wrong. \n",
      "Yes, that's true. Did you know that Rotten Tomatoes is owned by Warner Brothers?\n",
      "No, I didn't. I also have no idea what it means when something is \"fresh\" on rotten tomatoes. Do you know?\n",
      "I think \"fresh\" means recommended - the percent of critics who support the film. But, with it being owned by a major studio, you have to wonder about bias.\n",
      "I agree. Maybe the studio liked it, and other people didn't...or vice versa. \n",
      "It would be interesting to study how WB films fare there versus their biggest competitors, and versus independent films.\n",
      "Yes. The Toy Story movies have a 100% rating, though, and I don't believe they are Warner Bros movies. \n",
      "Yes, and Spykids got 93%. If there is bias, it's probably subtle, but who knows.\n",
      "Have you seen SpyKids? I haven't. I loved that movie about the superhero kids in high school. What was that called? \n",
      "I haven't seen it. Did you know that Disney almost shut down their animation studios after Sleeping Beauty came out? It did very poorly at the box office.\n",
      "No, I didn't know that. I don't think I have ever seen the movie, Sleeping Beauty, although I did have the paper dolls when I was a little girl.\n",
      "Yeah, Disney's had some ups and downs. Treasure Planet was one of the most expensive box office failures of all time.\n",
      "Is that the one that was a Muppet movie? Oh, no I think that was Treasure Island. I didn't see either one of those. Disney has had some box office home runs, though, like the whole Pirates of the Caribbean series. \n",
      "Yes, they've had a lot of success! I find it comforting to think of them having failures too - we all have our ups and downs.\n",
      "Yes. It makes it seem a little less like Disney is taking over the world. They even own the Star Wars movies now. \n",
      "Yes! Well, it's been good talking to you. Have a good night!\n",
      "You, too! Have a great night. Happy New Year! \n",
      "Happy new year!\n",
      "\n",

      "did you know the universe might be a hologram?\n",
      "No, that is an interesting theory though I would say. \n",
      "I know that is what Elon Musk believes, not that he would 100% know but he seems pretty smart\n",
      "Yeah he is definitely very smart.  I guess there is also a theory where there is just one electron in the whole universe as well. \n",
      "hmm that is strange I haven't heard that, kim jong un has a degree in physics so maybe he knows haha\n",
      "Holy cow, I didn't know that about him, very interesting. \n",
      "I wonder what university he got it, and he's the supreme leader so did they just let him pass? haha\n",
      "Yeah maybe he just said I have one, and they gave him one lol.  Did you know the emperor of Japan is a scientist?\n",
      "I didn't, do you know what kind of scientist he is? I wonder what his specialty is\n",
      "Yeah I wonder that as well.  I guess Harrison Schmitt was the only scientist that walked on the moon. \n",
      "that seems weird that the other astronauts either wouldn't be scientists or wouldn't be considered scientists, I do know that the wolfram alpha creator got his phd at the age of 20 which is insane\n",
      "Holy smokes that is insane.  It's crazy how smart some people are.  \n",
      "ya I always wonder if it was genetic, or parenting, or honestly its probably a bit of both\n",
      "Yeah there is always some genetics at work.  Did you know the internet was created by a scientist?\n",
      "haha well I would have guessed that, I know al gore claimed to have created the internet but I don't know the story behind that, don't think hes a scientist though\n",
      "Yeah I always thought that rumor was hilarious.  He was working for the Cern I guess. \n",
      "lol ya I guess! but speaking of smart people this says john von neumann when he was 6 could speak ancient greek, like you don't just learn that at 6 your parents have to get involved for that to happen\n",
      "What, that is too crazy.  Yeah that is working overtime by the parents!\n",
      "ya that I think may be a little much, but on the other hand he grew up to be a genius so who knows! \n",
      "Yeah who knows, I'm sure he won't be a bum when he gets older lol. \n",
      "ya the emperor of japan is actually publishing papers, I wonder what kind of papers trump would publish if he were a scientist haha\n",
      "Oh geez I'm sure they would be pretty bad.  Well it was nice talking with you today, hope you enjoy the weekend. \n",

      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "I'm great, what do you think about Stephen Hawking and his beliefs about God\n",
      "I think he is brilliant and his ideologies are definitely worth knowing. You?\n",
      "I agree he was brilliant and came up with interesting theories and facts about the universe, I tend to agree with some of his ideas about God and church\n",
      "I wonder if his atheism is related to science and the larger universe.\n",
      "I think it is, the more you read and learn the more you will question yourself and your beliefs, too bad he died altough with his condition im suprised he made it to age 76\n",
      "I agree. I was shocked he made it that long. I know I took a ton of science classes in college and started questioning everything. I really tried to read his books but they were so far over my head.\n",
      "Yea ha they are hard to follow, did you ever read The Theory of Everything? its a great book but hard to understand\n",
      "No, I tried to read a brief history of time. It was not brief and made me feel bad about myself.\n",
      "It was pretty long indeed lol, but I guess the title says brief because of how big the universe actually is and it would take an enormous book to document only what we know up to date in a summarized way\n",
      "Did you read it? I ever tried reading it upside down so it would force me to read it more carefully and concentrate. Only book I had trouble with. Well, that and organic chemistry.\n",
      "I tried to read it and read some pages but never finished it, you know that there are scientists who believe that universes also evolve through natural selection\n",
      "That's weird. Not something I would have thought of. Or it could be one giant superhologram.\n",
      "One superhologram? I guess thats a valid theory as well, we know so little about space everything is possible.\n",
      "Like there is only one electron in the universe? Where is it and who has it?\n",
      "Too many questions and few answers, I guess its a good thing we have physics, at least we can answer some question by applying them.\n",
      "Not if the physicist is Kim Jong-Un. You may just get shot...\n",
      "I agree, I think he has a false degree on physics he sure lies a lot. \n",
      "I agree. He may have a degree but it's definitely not legit. What are his professors going to do, fail him?\n",
      "Thats true, not a lot of options there lol,  there is a theory that states that the universe could have come from nothing,\n",
      "Nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Hi, do you like science?\n",
      "Hello, Yes I do. How about you? I think that Mr. Hawkings was a intelligent man. \n",
      "He really was, one of his conclusions was that God does not exist.\n",
      "I believe that as well. He was a man who had great intelligence and understanding of our universe and not only that but he spoke to many religious leaders like a few popes and others.\n",
      "I do not think that way, but I really admired Hawkins because despite the hard disease he had , the Lou Gehrig disease, he was really a great scientist and very curious.\n",
      "He certainly persevered in spite of his illness. Regarding our universe, did you know that there are stars that are cold enough that a human could touch it?  \n",
      "I had no idea, but I love to learn new things about the universe! I love to know about galaxies, stars, planets etc.\n",
      "Me too, and there is so much to learn about. I have always loved physics. It helps to understand our world and how the universe behaves. \n",
      "I did like to learn that pixar spent 3 years studying physics of curly hair\n",
      "Wow, that must be a lot of information to study for 3 years. Did you know that Kim jong-un has a degree in physics? \n",
      "Interesting! I find the objective of studying physics really interesting- it's to understand how the universe behaves!\n",
      "Absolutely!!  There is never ending things to learn about the universe. I read that scientists at Harvard stored a gif animation of a galloping horse in the dna of bacteria! I can not imagine why but I am sure they know lol.\n",
      "They do impressive things! Like Harrison Schmitt, he was the only one who walked on the moon, that is great.\n",
      "What a magnificent experience that must have been for him! Jon Von Neumann could divide two 8 digit numbers in his head by age 6 and he could also talk in ancient greek! Amazing thing they can do. \n",
      "That is amazing! another great invention by scientists is the World Wide Web, it has greatly affected our lives\n",
      "Oh yes it certainly has. All parts of our lives have been affected by it!These scientists are so intelligent. The creator of Wolfram Alpha got his PHD at the age of 20!\n",
      "It is interesting that this term started to be used in the 19th century, before it was sometimes known as natural philosophy\n",
      "Yes things have changed and advanced through the years. I believe that there will always be more things to learn about our world and we have only learned a small amount of what is out there. So many things we were able to get after we learned about physics. \n",
      "We are in the very beginning, I am really interested in learning more, and my favorite part of physics is astronomy, which is one of the most ancient disciplines.\n",
      "Astronomy is a fascinating topic. We do live in an amazing world. Never stop learning and growing. \n",
      "Neither do you, It was really nice talking to you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi!  Are you a Beatles fan?\n",
      "Who isn't. John did some incredible stuff\n",
      "Sure!  They were real musical pioneers!\n",
      "absolutely, especially with Geoff Emerick as a sound engineer\n",
      "Yeah!  They were the first to do so many neat things that they redefined what it meant to do sound engineering.\n",
      "yeah have you heard the work done on Revolver?\n",
      "Sweet!  Amazing what they did as a band without even being able to read music!\n",
      "Yeah it really was art\n",
      "And their genius stands the test of time. The Beatles have the best selling albums of the 2000's!  \n",
      "Yep and they use the word love 613 times!\n",
      "My first words as a baby came straight from the lyrics of one of their songs on the album, Meet the Beatles. They were influential in my life, but are largely regarded as the most influential band in US history.\n",
      "Which is especially impressive given they're not American. Paul even composes classical music.\n",
      "Really? Cool!  I thought it was inspirational when I learned that Ringo was illiterate for much of his childhood due to years of missed schooling from illness. Amazingly, he later went on to be a Narrator on the Thomas the Tank Engine children's TV show! \n",
      "Yeah that's pretty impressive that he was able to do that, I grew up watching that show\n",
      "I remember how the Beatles became so popular that they had to stop touring because the screams from the fans were so loud.  \n",
      "Yeah they were so popular with Beatlemania\n",
      "Right, I forgot about that! Well, mania is not uncommon with the latest fad music. Believe it or not, even classical music had loud, wild, moving audiences during performances back in the day.\n",
      "Oh for sure, you ever see the movie Armadeus? It really was the popular music of the time\n",
      "Yeah. Even today, some fans are so obsessed with the music it is amazing. Like, there is one dude, Arthur Lintgen, who can identify a piece of classical music by simply looking at the grooves on a vinyl record.  \n",
      "Classical music have also been used to decrease crime in cities all over the world, it's fascinating.\n",
      "Yeah, and to curb teen loitering in shopping centers. Hey, nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good afternoon. Did you hear about John Lennon wanting to sound like the Dalai Lama?\n",
      "Yeah, the Beatles went through a phase with that stuff.  Harrison is the only one that stuck with it. \n",
      "I didn't realize the Beatles have been around since 1960.\n",
      "Yeah, that must count their time in Europe (e.g., Hamburg).  I didn't know that none of them could read music. \n",
      "Ringo star was illiterate for most of his childhood.\n",
      "Hmm.  I guess he did OK for himself just having rhythm. Emerick used a \"rotating Leslie speaker\" -- never heard of such a thing. \n",
      "Never heard of that either. I read they stopped touring bc current amplification technology couldn't keep up over the screaming.\n",
      "Yeah, girls can be loud.  I was surprised to learn that Emerick worked with Elvis Costello... He's one of my favorites. \n",
      "Do you use the internet a lot? The Russians built a computer that ran on water.\n",
      "Yes.  As an engineer I appreciate his philosophy that \"Everything is possible, nothing is impossible.\" \n",
      "That's a good quote. Did you know smoking near an apple computer voids the warranty?\n",
      "I heard that.  I didn't know that the Beatles song \"Come Together\" was for a Timothy Leary's CA governor's campaign. \n",
      "O that's pretty cool. I wonder if he won.\n",
      "I don't think so.  LSD wouldn't go over as a qualification.  Are you into computers?\n",
      "Yes I am. I read the space shuttles general purpose computers runs on 1mb ram.\n",
      "Yeah, there were 3 of them that used \"voting\" to get better results.  I bet they didn't smoke near them. :)\n",
      "That's funny. Did you see the one built from mine craft building blocks?\n",
      "Never saw a pic of that.  Do you like classical music?  Some don't like teenagers at a shopping center in Australia where it's used to keep them from loitering. \n",
      "That's cool. Some cities are using the music to deter crime.\n",
      "Cool. I can't believe that in 2011 a computer actually composed a piece of classical music. \n",
      "That's cool. I heard audiences get loud, at classical concerts. Nice chatting with you\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi are you a fan of the Beatles?\n",
      "Yes, i like the beatles very much. You?\n",
      "I'm a fan!  It's going to be 60 years next year since they were first formed in Liverpool in 1960.  I can't believe it's been that long.\n",
      "Yeah, i feel old LOL They really evolved over the years. I was sad that they break up, but i understand why.\n",
      "Yes.  Amazingly the Beatles have the best selling album of the 2000's!  Pretty amazing that they still have that kind of fan power still.\n",
      "They wrote the classic songs that influenced so many musicians. I dont know what their first hit was though.\n",
      "You know what?  I don't that.  I think it's because they have so many good songs.  The Beatles wrote \"Come Together\" for Timothy Leary's 1969 California governor campaign.  \n",
      "I never knew that. Timothy Leary, the LSD guy? Come Together? Ok, i guess he needed a song. it is a cool song too.\n",
      "That surprised me.  That must have been when John was already heavy into politics.  Ringo was illiterate for most of his childhood because he missed 3 years of school due to tuberculosis and peritonitis.\n",
      "That is amazing! I am surprised he didnt die. i wonder what he did with his time. did he listen to music?\n",
      "I'm not sure.  The Beatles stopped touring because the amplification technology of the time couldn't keep up over the screaming!\n",
      "The fans were fanatics. i would go to hear the music and just hear screaming. not worth it. i would just listen to the albums.\n",
      "Yes...I don't think they really toured that much here in the states.  Here's an interesting fact:  none of the Beatles could read music.\n",
      "Most of them learned to play by ear, which is typical of rock and pop musicians. \n",
      "Yes!  I've heard that of a lot of musicians.  Do you know anything interesting about computers?\n",
      "I know that the russians built a computer powered by water back in 1930s.\n",
      "I wonder how that worked?  They must have used the water to generate a power source.  I didn't even know they had computers back then. lol\n",
      "There were mechanical computers before that. computers are an old idea. someone built one in minecraft even!\n",
      "I wonder how that worked? lol  The space shuttles general purpose computer ran on 1mb of ram.  Crazy.  It's been fun chatting!\n",
      "The programmers used the RAM carefully. Yes, i have fun chatting!\n",
      "Have a good day!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi good morning. Are you a fan of the Beatles? They have the best selling album of the 2000s!\n",
      "I expect that the Beatles will have a best selling album for the next century as well! \n",
      "Yeah that's a good point I bet as well. Surprisingly though none of the Beatles could read music.\n",
      "Like many rocks musicians, they learned by ear. Reading music is useful though. I don't think it would have made a difference for the Beatles.\n",
      "Yeah that's true. Ringo Starr couldn't read at all as he was a illiterate for most of his childhood.\n",
      "He was a good drummer. I did not know that he was illiterate. \n",
      "Yeah it sounds like he missed three years of school due to tuberculosis and peritonitis.\n",
      "Wow, that's terrible. I'm glad he survived. That must have been hard. I guess he developed an interest in music then.\n",
      "Yeah it would be interesting to hear their story. I would also like to know how they all met and came together in 1960 when they formed.\n",
      "I guess they were all in Liverpool. I guess they played in the same clubs. I guess they were not going to college or uni.\n",
      "Following their dream that is great. I think it's cool that the Beatles experimented with several music styles ranging from pop and Indian music to hard rock.\n",
      "That is the best thing about them. They did not just do the same stuff again and again. They traveled. They explored.\n",
      "Yeah that's a really good point. The Beatles once literally stopped touring because current amplification technology couldn't keep up over screaming.\n",
      "It would have been pointless anyway. The fans were not listening. They wanted a Beatles experience. I would not have gone myself.\n",
      "Yeah it sounds super crazy. I can just watch from the comfort of my own computer. Speaking of computers someone build a working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic Minecraft building blocks.\n",
      "I am amazed that they would even try. That must have taken forever to build. I wonder why they did that.\n",
      "Yeah I can't even imagine. Also smoking near Apple computers voids the warranty by making it a biohazard. I am definitely glad I don't smoke!\n",
      "What about vaping? Can you vape?\n",
      "I don't know about vaping. \n",
      "Not if they couldn't vape anymore, they wouldn't! LOL Anyway, great chat!\n",
      "Yeah and they even have industrial robots controlled by computers. So surprising. Nice talking with you as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know about you, but one detail that I remember from my childhood is watching my brother play the Legend of Zelda on our Nintendo 64. Did you ever play that game?\n",
      "I don't play that game but I love Nintendo and I like playing Mario, always a favorite!\n",
      "I guess the company was first founded as a card playing company back in 1889, making it over a century old\n",
      "That's crazy! I had no idea! I really like Pokemon Go, I like the handheld console that they made just for that game. My son plays too and always wears his favorite lucky Pokemon Go shirt lol.\n",
      "That's fun that you have something you can enjoy together. Nintendo also owns the Mariners, meaning they do more than just video games. If you're at a Mariners game, you can use a 3DS app to order food to your seat\n",
      "It is great fun to play the pokemon go with my son, so Nintendo owns the Mariners?? Wow, that's crazy and interesting! They also produced lego knock offs at one point!\n",
      "I wonder how long that venture lasted. They also created the first racing game to run at 60 frames per second. It's crazy how much technology has evolved over the past few decades\n",
      "I know, technology is amazing. I bet we see more and more pretty fast. I wonder if Nintendo has any games that you can play Tennis, that would be fun!\n",
      "I know the Wii Sports has tennis on it. I think I remember there also being a Mario Tennis game for the 64 as well. Do you play tennis?\n",
      "I love tennis, but don't get to play very often, but I do love tennis games and I do believe they have one for the Wii. I will have to check it out! It is funny to me all the businesses Nintendo tried prior to going to games in the 70's, they tried everything haha\n",
      "Many businesses that are now successful have similar stories. They learn how to pivot until they find something that is profitable. Now they're one of the largest and best-known video game companies in the world\n",
      "Very true! I wonder if Nintendo ever tried any clothing lines, like shirts and shorts, but I guess there are always clothes with brand names in graphics on them. They are huge, valued at over 85 billion dollars.\n",
      "Since they own the Mariners, I wonder if they technically do have some clothing. Sometimes we know things by their brand rather than the parent company\n",
      "Very true. I bet they have made clothes, it would be a huge market just to sell Tee shirts or even polo shirts like they wear in tennis.\n",
      "What's funny is that polo shirts started with tennis players before it was later worn by polo players. The name is deceiving\n",
      "I heard that, pretty interesting. I believe Rene ( the crocodile) Lacoste was the designer of polo shirts.\n",
      "That's what I've heard. What I didn't know is that there's a difference between a button down and a button up, depending on whether the collar tips fasten to the shirt\n",
      "Really? Haha, I did not know that, hmmm. That is as funny as in China gang fashion involved layering as many shirts as someone could put on and popping the collars, never knew that was a thing!\n",
      "I think I've seen photos of that before. It's not any stranger than the aloha shirt being the official business attire in Hawaii\n",
      "Right! That is pretty cool though, I am sure they love wearing shirts like that.\n",
      "It's probably more comfortable. Billy May's funeral pallbearers wore khaki pants and blue shirts to his funeral\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, do you watch tennis?\n",
      "Yes I like tennis more than I used to, especially when the williams sisters are playing. \n",
      "Yeah they are great. DO you know the relation between tennis and polo shirts?\n",
      "Yes I think that Polo shirts were invented for tennis players. I like polo shirts myself, do you? \n",
      "Yeah I like them. It was indeed Rene Lacoste the tennis player\n",
      "Oh ok, did you know a black man won the first us tennis open title in 1968?\n",
      "Yeah and the sad thing is that no other has won it ever since\n",
      "Yes that's true, my mind keep going back to Tiger Woods, but I have to remind myself Tiger Woods wasn't a black man.\n",
      "Yeah. And once they had to use a helicopter to dry a tennis court\n",
      "Wow that must had been an important and valuable game, I'm surprised that game wasn't postponed.\n",
      "Yeah true. Do you know how long was the longest match in tennis?\n",
      "If I am right the longest tennis match went for 11 hours within 3 days, that's a lot of energy for a player.\n",
      "That is true. How about video games?\n",
      "I am surprised that Nintendo is and not was the world's largest video game companies by market capitalization.\n",
      "Yeah, and it is over 100 years old now since it was founded in 1889\n",
      "Did you know Nintendo owns the Seattle Mariners? Nintendo release handheld console for pokemon?\n",
      "Oh I did not know that. THey also used to be a toy company and created a lego knock-off then\n",
      "Oh really, have you heard of the arrow shirt collar? Those were my favorite shirts in my teens.\n",
      "I have actually not heard of them. DO you know how polo shirts were invented?\n",
      "No not really, how were the polo shirts were Invented, If you know can you brief me short details? \n",
      "They were invented by the tennis player, Rene Lacoste. Nice chat\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you this morning?\n",
      "Im doing great. How bout you.\n",
      "I'm good, thanks for asking.  Do you like Tennis?\n",
      "I have never really sat down to watch it to be honest.\n",
      "I watch a little, mainly the Open when it's playing.  Do you realize a black man has not won te US open tennis title since 1968?\n",
      "Thats crazy. \n",
      "Yeah, you would think with Serena and her sister Venus dominating on the women's side, a black man would represent, as well?\n",
      "You would think that huh. Maybe they should grunt more. I guess it gives ou a leg up in tennis.\n",
      "Apparently! lol I just learned recently that polp shirts were originally invented for tennis.\n",
      "I didnt know that. I used to play table tennis. do you like table tennis.\n",
      "Yes, I played as a kid.  Was pretty good actually, I picked it quick.\n",
      "You dont get really good until ou learn to put that side english on the ball. Lol.\n",
      "True that! Ever played Nintendo?\n",
      "all the time when I was a kid. Love me some mario.\n",
      "Me too, I didn't realize they started out as a \n",
      " playing card company way back in 1889.\n",
      "A long time age they have came a long way huh. Did you know that NES had online gameplay capabilities\n",
      "Yes, you know they are the 3rd most valuable company in Japan with a market value over $85 Billion?\n",
      "Wow. that is really amazing. A lot of money.\n",
      "Yes, it is.  Did you know Nintendo owns the Seattle Mariners?\n",
      "Thats cool. Guess its really true how big of baseball fans the Japanese people are.\n",
      "Yes, they are.  I've visited Japan many times , they are crazy about baseball and video games.  Well, it's been nice chatting with you this morning.  Have a good day, friend!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How's it going, have you've ever played Nintendo games? It was founded in 1889 way before video games were made\n",
      "I like nintendo very much. Especially f-zero which is the first racing game to run at 60 fps\n",
      "It's crazy how much stuff nintendo use to do before video games, like cab services and love hotels\n",
      "They even made a lego knockoff before they produced videogames. They have a great many videogame franchises\n",
      "Yea I love Mario, Pokemon, and Zelda, they are all great franchises\n",
      "The newest mario game is supposed to be very good.\n",
      "Yea it's pretty good. Did you know Nintendo owns the Seattle Mariners?\n",
      "Yes, they even have a 3ds app for ordering food to your seat, crazy!\n",
      "I wonder if Nintendo owns any other sports teams, they do have a market value of 85 billion\n",
      "That value is probably why they were able to release a console specifically for pokemon\n",
      "I wonder how much the original playing cards Nintendo made in 1889 are worth now\n",
      "There are probably many other items that they made as well, I wonder if they ever made polo shirts\n",
      "Nintendo did make mario tennis games. Tennis is a pretty crazy sport, the longest match was 11 hours\n",
      "There have been many interesting tennis matches. The first black man won the 1st US open title in 1968\n",
      "It's odd that a black man has never won the US open since then\n",
      "Just one year after that victory they used a helicopter to dry the fields at the us open\n",
      "It's crazy Polos were originally invented for Rene Lacoste\n",
      "gangs in china used to layer polos and pop the collars\n",
      "Interesting, did you know the pallbearers at Billy Mays' funeral wore blue shirts and khakis just like Mays use to?\n",
      "That is interesting that they didn't wear buttoned shirts\n",
      "Well I got to go, nice chatting with you\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi. How are you?\n",
      "I'm doing well how are you!?\n",
      "I am good too.\n",
      "Are you a fan of superheroes?\n",
      "Yes. I like superhero movies.\n",
      "Have you seen any of the new spider man movies?\n",
      "I have seen the one before this recent one. I will watch the latest as soon as I can.\n",
      "Can you believe a teen injected himeslef with mercury at least three times in an attempt to convert his bones to metal after seeing x-men?\n",
      "Yes. That is  crazy  stuff.\n",
      "It really is! Can you believe Michael Jackson tried buying Marvel in the 90's?\n",
      "No I did not know that. I did see that in the opening to 1990s spider man was performed by Joe Perry.\n",
      "Wow that is awesome. I wonder if it was good? I'll have to listen to it sometime! Do you know where the word brainiac came from?\n",
      "I remember a brainiac  character from the superman comics when I was a kid.\n",
      "That's where it came from! I can't believe DC Comics only paid 130 dollars for the rights to superman!\n",
      "Yes that was a great deal for them.\n",
      "Marvel does great things though, did you hear what they did about a kid with hearing aids?\n",
      "No I have not.\n",
      "Some kid was saying that superheroes don't wear hearing aids to his mother, so Marvel created a superhero that does. So cool!\n",
      "That was  a cool thing for them to do.\n",
      "It really was! Anyways nice chatting with you!\n",
      "You too. Have a good day.\n",
      "Thanks!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, do you like Marvel? \n",
      "Oh yes very fun company! I am happy with how the Walt Disney company has handled things since acquiring them in 2009.\n",
      "Me too. I saw Marvel started in 1939.\n",
      "Yes it has been around for a while. But at that time they were called Timely Publications.\n",
      "Very cool stat right there. They once created a superhero for a boy who was deaf.\n",
      "Such a nice thing to do. Are you referring to blue ear? I love when companies do things like that. \n",
      "Yep, that is Blue Ear. Such a good thing to do. Melts my heart hearing stories like that.\n",
      "It really does! Do you like the Marvel character Spider-man? He is the only character who Sony has the rights to!\n",
      "I love Spider Man. I did not know that Sony had rights to him.\n",
      "Yes back in 1998 they bought the rights for $10 million!\n",
      "Wow that's a lot of money. I saw the military is trying to make a spider-man like abilities for soldiers.\n",
      "Hah that would be epic! There was 700 comic issues of the Amazing Spider Man. \n",
      "That's a lot! Sad that Stan Lee passed away this year. He brought a lot of joy to the world.\n",
      "I was sad to hear about his passing. He left a great legacy though. He received 10% of the net profits of anything based on his characters!\n",
      "That's very cool he got that legacy. Do you read comic books ever?\n",
      "I did in the past. I liked both Marvel and DC comics. DC stands for detective comics.\n",
      "Me too. I didn't know that's what it stands for. Very cool to know.\n",
      "If you ever want to see the largest publicly available comic book collection, just go to The Michigan State University Library!\n",
      "That's hilarious. I'm not too far from Michigan so I'll have to drive up there and check it out one day.\n",
      "Yeah that would be really cool to see. It is a huge market and it was valued at 1.09 billion dollars in 2016. Well it was lovely being able to talk with you today!\n",
      "For sure. Good chatting with you today!\n",
      "\n",

      "Hi, how are you? do you like Marvel\n",
      "Hello, I am doing good this morning. Yeah I like Marvel. Me and my son are always watching superhero movies. \n",
      "Nice, me too although I am not a huge Fantastic Four fan. I think the movie killed it for me...\n",
      "Yeah, we havnt seen that one yet, and he isnt at the age to get into comic books yet. \n",
      "That makes sense. Sony turned down most of marvel's characthers in 1998 and spent $10M on spiderman. That was not a great choice but siderman is making some money.\n",
      "Im not big on spiderman. I know it probably makes them a lot of money but I personally think X-Men is a lot better show. It wouldnt have hurt Disneys wallet any to throw in another 15 million for X-Men. Im sure Marvel came out on that deal anyway.\n",
      "Yeah! I too love X-Men. I own the DVDs of all the cartoons. I will throw them in every few month and get nostolgic about them. Really like them. Who's your favorite\n",
      "Wolverine. I like the story behind him, and he just seems like a real dude as well.\n",
      "Yeah. He's one of my favorites; I always felt bad for him. I like Night Crawler the most though. I like his powers. \n",
      "If I could pick on power to have it would be professor Xaviors. To be able to read and control minds would be crazy.\n",
      "Yeah, that would be nice. Did you know there is a characther that is owned by both Marvel and DC, named access?\n",
      "I didnt know that, whats he like. \n",
      "He looks a little corny with blue costume and red piping but his job is to stop the two universes from becomming one. \n",
      "Oh yeah. If they did what a world it would be, huh. SSo why do you think Spider Man has always been so popular. I just dont see it.\n",
      "I really liked the first one but the new ones have been tough to watch. I do like Andrew Garfield though. I heard 3 companies own his rights so they all have a spin, which is why there are a lot of them and different versions.\n",
      "3 companies huh. I think they need to stick to one storyline at a time, and really go deep into it. I want a story that makes me want to watch it to see what happens next and Spiderman just doesnt do that for me.\n",
      "I agree. I heard the new Spiderman Universe cartoon movie was really good. I would like to see that one.\n",
      "I hadnt heard of it till now. Its just crazy the amount of money they make from this kind of stuff though. \n",
      "Yeah. I just saw the latest Avengers movie on Netflix and was surprissed to see him on there...\n",
      "I think he is good in roles like that. Just one of the group. I dont think the story is interesting enough to make a series based just on Spider Man.\n",
      "I agree. Nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a Marvel Fan?  They just released a new Marvel \"Fantastic Four\" comic book last week.  \n",
      "I do like marvel but not the fantastic 4 really. What about you?\n",
      "I like \"the Amazing Spider-Man.\"  Marvel is discontinuing publishing the Fantastic Four so I guess it's not as popular.\n",
      "Now that's sad. I may not like it but isn't it a staple in comic books?\n",
      "Marvel offered rights to Sony for almost all its characters for 25 million but they rejected.  They would've made a fortune.\n",
      "Man, that would suck to be that CEO... Lost billions! Maybe someone can pick up Fantastic four and pump life into that!\n",
      "Marvel finds all kinds of ways to make and save money.  They even argued in court that xmen are not human so they can pay a lower rate.\n",
      "Weird... The US military is trying to acheive spiderman like abilities. I would love to have that tech!\n",
      "Disney probably has the rights to it though.  But they don't have the right to show \"big\" marvel characters in their theme parks east of the Mississippi due to contracts with Marvel.\n",
      "Really? That's odd. Stan lee would probably get 10% though...\n",
      "Marvel has some good traits though giving a hard of hearing boy who didn't want to wear a hearing aid a superhero blue ear.\n",
      "That'd be so cool for a little boy. Im glad they could do that!\n",
      "Did you know that DC stands for Detective Comics, not Washington, DC\n",
      "That's interesting. I did not know that. Did you know Access is owned by both DC and Marvel.\n",
      "I wasn't aware, but if you like the Marvel comics, then head to Michigan State university for the largest comic collection in the world.\n",
      "Really! Im an Illini guy so I can't step on that campus...\n",
      "Spiderman's opening was performed by Aerosmith's Joe Perry.  No wonder it's so good the music.\n",
      "That's so interesting. I like Joe Perry!\n",
      "Stan Lee was rich.  He got 10% of net profits of anything from his characters and the first Spiderman got $800 million in revenue.\n",
      "I would have taken 5%! Can you imaine being that rich? I bet he's not doing HITs.\n",
      "Marvel even had a wedding in 1987 for Spiderman with Stan Lee officiating.  He probably got paid big too for that one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "Hi, I'm good. How are you?  Do you read any marvel comics or watch the movies?\n",
      "I do. I really like them. Do you?\n",
      "i like some of them.  I am hoping there are more movies now that Walt Disney has bought Marvel.  I imagine Marvel characters are at the theme parks too.\n",
      "Probably. There will probably be a whole wing of the park for them and star wars, now that they own them too.\n",
      "i am sure that you are right about that!  Did you know that Disney does not own the rights to the big marvel characters east of the mississippi?\n",
      "I did not but now that I am thinking of it, I may have seen thor at Universal in Orlando.\n",
      "You probably did.  Marvel signed a contract with Universal back in the 1990s so Disney can't show the characters at Disney World but they can at Disney Land.\n",
      "I think Disney would be able to do more with them in terms of movies and rides. But Universal probably has plans...\n",
      "i bet they do.  You know Sony had the chance to buy them but only bought Spiderman because they thought that was all people would care about.  They were so wrong!\n",
      "Yeah! There is one charatcher that is owned by marvel and DC. have you heard about this person?\n",
      "No I haven't.  What's the scoop on that?  I had no idea DC would own something with Marvel.\n",
      "I guess his name is access and he makes sure the characters do not cross into the other universe.\n",
      "Talk about taking stuff too seriously!  I mean, they are only comic book characters in a comic book universe.  Then again, Marvel was able to argue in court that mutants are not people in order to pay a lower rate for the action figures.  I can't imagine going to court to argue about x-men!\n",
      "What if the financial difference was hundreds of millions. It's worth a shot, right?\n",
      "i guess you are right about that.  I just don't know how i would keep a straight face as the lawyer or judge though.\n",
      "I am sure there are a lot of cases that both people laugh at but if it pays off, it would be worth it. If Marvel or DC has in-house lawyers, they are salaried so make them earn their keep!\n",
      "True, very true!  I bet it was fun working for Stan Lee too.  I heard he always ended every phone call with the word- excelsior!\n",
      "I wish I had a cool line like that when I hung up the phone.  Do you have one?\n",
      "No i don't but I wish I did too.  You've got to be a non conformist I think in order to be as creative as he was you know what i mean?  He was smart too.  His company published a generic comic book so they could trademark the names super-hero and super-villain.\n",
      "Nice chatting with you!\n",

      "The Venom movie is coming soon.  Are you going to see it?\n",
      "Well, it does star Tom Hardy. So maybe.\n",
      "He was one of Spider Man' villains.\n",
      "I know. I wonder why they decided to use venom in this movie. I like some of the other villains\n",
      "Venom is a catchy name.  Wonder if it will be true to the comic book, or go its own way.\n",
      "I think it won't be true at all.They need to attract all sorts of audiences.\n",
      "Deadpool stuck closely to the comic book and does very well as a franchise.\n",
      "Of course, Ryan reynolds is great, and very funny.\n",
      "Who ever thought that comic book villains could become subjects of movies?  Sort of an anti-hero.\n",
      "Yea, people like that stuff. Also, all sorts of hero movies are in at this time. Did you know marvel published a generic comic book in order to trade mark the names super-hero and super-villain?\n",
      "It doesn't surprise me.  Rumors are that Carnage, another Spider Man villain, will be Venom's antagonist.\n",
      "is Carnage evil?\n",
      "Oh, yeah.  Carnage is even more lethal than Venom.\n",
      "What makes him so lethal?\n",
      "He has power similar to SpiderMan, but is an alien.\n",
      "that's crazy had no idea. I wonder if he was human at some point too.\n",
      "No.  Carnage is an extraterrestrial parasite, and is an enemy of Venom.  I think the long range goal is eventually tie everything together into a SpiderMan mega-movie.\n",
      "Wow, amazing.Who is playing Peter Parker now a days?\n",
      "No idea.  They have different Batmans all the time, why not Spider Mans.\n",
      "Always felt George Clooney was the best.\n",
      "Spider Man has been so successful.  Sony bought the rights for $10M in 1998.  What a bargain!\n",

      "How's it going, do you swim? People are able to swim weeks after birth\n",
      "I'm afraid to ask what Elmo testified to Congress about. Something about funding PBS, maybe?\n",
      "Maybe, or maybe elmo cheated on his taxes \n",
      "LOL. Sorry, I didn't see your initial comment. No, I don't swim. Do you? I remember the swimming baby on the cover of Nirvana's Nevermind.\n",
      "Yea if there is a pool around, I'd really like to learn how to do the front crawl that Native Americans introduced to the British\n",
      "Interesting. I don't live near a pool and the water outdoors is very cold here most of the year, but I do a lot of walking for cardio.\n",
      "I like to watch swimming on the Olympics, The US almost as many gold medals in swimming than the rest of the world combined!\n",
      "I wonder why the US is better at swimming. I never watch the Olympics much, but it's interesting how countries develop a division of labor on what they're good at.\n",
      "I don't know, maybe it has to do with the swimsuits. The olympics did ban one swimsuit worn by 94% of the winners in the 2008 races\n",
      "That's weird. I wonder what they thought was unfair about it -- I'd have thought choosing swimsuits for characteristics that aided speed would just be an accepted thing.\n",
      "I guess not, maybe Congress found something unproper about the olympic swimsuits\n",
      "I don't get why, if it was available for everyone to wear. \n",
      "I guess everyone didn't have access to it. Did you know there is a type of swimming were people swim just like dolphins?\n",
      "I noticed that. I've heard of some weird ideas for sports, but that's out there. On the subject of shoes, my old work boots have lasted me about 6 years but it's about time to get some new ones at the surplus store. Do you have many pairs of shoes?\n",
      "I think I have 2 pairs of shoes. It's crazy there is 5000 year old shoes that perform better than modern shoes\n",
      "I'm not surprised, considering how much stuff today is deliberately designed to fall apart so you have to buy more. Sounds like you've got about as many shoes as I do.\n",
      "I wonder how reliable the $15 shoes Stephon Marbury promotes are\n",
      "I should google them. But I really need heavy boots -- I usually get army surplus or steel-toed lineman's boots.\n",
      "I think I need to buy some tea bags from my shoes to see if they really do absorb odor\n",
      "I usually have a lot of used teabags, so I should try that too.\n",
      "Well I got to go, nice chatting with you\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hey there.  I live in upstate NY near Cornell.  Students there must pass a basic swimming test before they can graduate.\n",
      "I've heard of a few schools who have that requirement. That might be why the US has more Olympic golds in that than the other countries combined\n",
      "could be.  wonder if we have ever won anything where the swimmers arms and legs are bound and they have to swim like a dolphin.\n",
      "That would be an interesting one to watch in the Olympics. Maybe they'll allow them to wear the swimsuit that is not banned. It's so good that in the 2008 Olympics, 94% of the winners were wearing them\n",
      "that's interesting.  i like watching swimming in every summer olympics.  it is always among the top public recreational sport too.\n",
      "The Native Americans were even avid swimmers. The British only knew the breaststroke until the Native Americans beat them using the front crawl\n",
      "that's cool.  the british also chose the name Congress for the 13 colonies to be recognized as a self governing entity.\n",
      "The term Congress even dates back to the Middle Ages and was used for a parley during battle\n",
      "Cool.  I heard Elmo is the only non-human to testify before the US Congress  hahaha\n",
      "Did he testify, or did his puppeteer testify? That's a bit of a gray area if you ask me\n",
      "true, kinda like fantasy Congress where players draft members of congress and get points for legislative success.  kinda nerdy if you ask me though.\n",
      "Unless that's what you're studying. I'm not into politics enough for that, but I would like to see the baseball game between the Republicans and Democrats in Congress\n",
      "that would be cool.  they have done that annually since 1909.  pretty cool\n",
      "The Republicans are winning by three, but it would only take a few years for that lead to change\n",
      "true. i like that there are subway lines between the capitol, house and senate buildings for exclusive use by congressman.  probably gives them more time for baseball.\n",
      "Three different lines, too. Maybe that was a woman's idea. It's funny how a woman was elected to Congress before women had the right to vote\n",
      "true, it's amazing in today's world that women could not vote back then in 1916\n",
      "I know. And that means she was voted in entirely by men\n",
      "good point.  i just hope Elmo never gets to vote.  I just saw that Steve Smith from the NFL Carolina Panthers leaves his cleats on the field after every game to raise awareness for homlessness.  interesting\n",
      "Considering that modern shoes don't perform as well as shoes from 5,000 years ago, he's not losing much by leaving them there\n",
      "well, if shoes lasted a long time these days, then shoe companies wouldn't sell as many shoes.  like ballet dancers who go through 4 pairs in a week.\n",
      "Not to mention the shoes that get thrown out due to their smell. One remedy for smelly shoes is using dry tea bags\n",
      "dry tea bags!  that would be cool.  but not on my daughters soccer cleats.  no way! lol  it's funny how fashion dictates shoes having heels or not and how high.  comfort is what i need.\n",
      "I like when comfort and style meet in the same shoe. It's the best of both worlds!\n",
      "\n",

      "Do you like to swim?\n",
      "I love swimming. Do not think that I am a professional, I am not a professional.\n",
      "It's okay.  Most people swim for recreation and exercise.\n",
      "I can only doggie paddle. Do you like to swim?\n",
      "I do.  I enjoy swimming in summer with my grandchildren. I also enjoy watching swimming competition in the Olympics.\n",
      "That is sweet. Who is your favorite swimmer athlete?\n",
      "Michael Phelps\n",
      "I saw him in the Ellen DeGeneres show. He was teaching Andy how to swim.\n",
      "That was cool.  Do you know that native americans introduced the front crawl swimming to the west?\n",
      "What is the front crawl swimming?\n",
      "Just like it sounds.  It mostly uses hand strength.  The British people only used breaststroke before it was introduced by the native americans.\n",
      "Isn't that like the butterfly strokes?\n",
      "I think it is similar.  By the way, the US received as many as gold medals in the Olympics in swimming as the rest of the world combined.\n",
      "Well, then maybe our practices increases way more stability.\n",
      "For sure.  Did you hear that there was one type of swimsuit that was banned by the Olympics?\n",
      "Maybe, bikinis were banned.\n",
      "It has nothing to do with appearance.  It was because 94% of swimmers wearing the banned swimsuit won the races during 2008 Olympic.\n",
      "That is weird. What a ridiculous situation.\n",
      "It is.  Also, Cornell university students must pass a basic swimming test before they are allowed to graduate.  That is a ridiculous requirement.\n",
      "That is ridiculous. I would definitely lose. Good thing my major is not in Cornell.\n",

      "Do you like trees? I find nature fascinating. \n",
      "Tree are very fascinating indeed! Did you know some male trees can turn female?\n",
      "I didnt know that, didnt even know that trees had genders also lol,\n",
      "I didn't either! Are you into the fantasy genre?\n",
      "I like fantasy yeah and also play fantasy games like fantasy football do you like the genre?\n",
      "I like fantasy football too haha and yes I kind of get into it. Did you know Lord of the Rings is the first and only fantasy film ever to win an academy award for best picture?\n",
      "Lord of the Rings is a great franchise I loved all the movies and I didnt know that, it does make sense though. \n",
      "I did too. There is an actual university where you can study science fiction and fantasy literature with a concentration of Tolkien studies! I'd be reading the lord of the rings everyday!\n",
      "That sounds like a nice university I wonder if George R.R. Martin ever attended that university, maybe he can be one of the teachers one day. \n",
      "That would be awesome! I wonder if the janitor who wrote a 15,145 page fantasy manuscript listened in on it?\n",
      "A janitor wrote a 15,145 page manuscript! woah he must be really famous by now wonder if his work is any good. \n",
      "It was only discovered after his death unfortunately! He did have 300 watercolor illustrations in it though!\n",
      "300 of them? that sounds impressive and too bad, maybe his manuscript is really good, he could have been a rich man, \n",
      "Oh for sure! Do you like science at all?\n",
      "I do like science, I think that scientists make big contributions to society, they make human kind better and smarter. \n",
      "Well said! Did you know the NFL has a coach who was a rocket scientist?\n",
      "I didnt know that, do you happen to know his name?\n",
      "It's Matt Patricia! He coaches the Lions and didn't have too great of a year this year haha.\n",
      "I guess his better off with rocket science lol, he must be a really smart man though. \n",
      "I think so myself haha. Anyways, great chatting with you!\n",
      "Another smart man the emperor of Japan he is also a scientist and it was great chatting, thanks for all the cool facts, bye. \n",

      "Are you a Spider-Man fan?\n",
      "I am not sure.  But I'd definitely see the recent Spider Man film.  I heard it was really good.  And it won some Oscars\n",
      "I heard it was really good, hes not my favorite superhero, but Id definitely see it also.\n",
      "Do you read any other comic books?\n",
      "No, never have read many of them.  I miss out on a lot of back story that way.\n",
      "Yeah, I never got into comic books or manga.  But I do like graphic novels.\n",
      "Cool.  Did you know Stan Lee used to end all of his phone conversations with \"Excelsior!\"\n",
      "No I didn't.  I heard Stan Lee wanted Spider-Man to have a hyphen so people didn't confuse it with Superman.  Makes sense to me.\n",
      "I agree.  There are so many superheroes, I can see why people can get them confused.\n",
      "Yes definitely.  Did you know the rival of Cap'n crunch, called Sogmaster, exists in Marvel.  He has fought Spiderman. Ha ha\n",
      "I didnt know Cap'n Crunch was a superhero.  Thats pretty cool.\n",
      "I know, ha ha.  Have you seen the movie Black Panther?\n",
      "I havent, I just saw that its on Netflix, so I have to check it out.\n",
      "Oh I didn't realize it was on Netflix already.  I'll have to watch it.  Did you know that Marvel invented a superhero called Blue Ear just to make a 4 year old boy feel better about wearing hearing aids?\n",
      "I heard about that.  That is the best.  I love things like that, it helps out kids realize that they are ok.\n",
      "Definitely.  Everyone needs to feel like they have super powers, but especially kids having a hard time!\n",
      "Plus, that way they feel that it is ok to be different.\n",
      "Yes.  Did you know the largest comic book market is Japan, and that France is another large market?\n",
      "I would believe that in Japan, but didnt realize that in France.\n",
      "Yeah, French people really like comic books, manga, and graphic novels.  There is a long tradition of comic books in France.\n",
      "Thats pretty cool.  Sony didnt take the rights to Marvel characters in 1998.  They only bought Spider-Man\n",
      "Wow I think Disney owns part of Marvel too.\n",
      "Just not the big character like the Xmen, and Avengers.  I am not sure who that leaves though.\n",
      "Oh okay.  Well speaking of comic books, I'd like to someday visit the comic collection at Michigan State University.  It's the largest comic collection in the world.  And its open to the public.\n",
      "That is pretty neat.  I bet it is pretty diverse.\n",
      "Yeah.  They must have comics from all over the world\n",
      "Probably a lot of older comics too.  That would be neat to see the development of comics.\n",
      "Yeah.  I think Marvel started in the 1930s or so.\n",
      "It would be cool if they even had stuff that predated Marvel, if that is even a thing.\n",
      "I think there are comics way before that.\n",
      "I think it is cool how they have different universes, even within the same franchise.\n",
      "Yeah, but it is a smart business decision to do that.\n",
      "I think it was even neat that Marvel published a generic comic book, just so they could trade mark superhero and supervillain.\n",
      "Totally.  Smart decisions.\n",
      "That is why they are legendary.  Its been great chatting!\n",
      "Same here.  Have a good evening\n",
      "You too!\n",

      "Since he was created in 1962, Spider-Man has really become popular.\n",
      "It really has.  I have not followed it much but there are at least 1/2 dozen movies.    its amazing Sony rejected buying the rights from Marvel for 25 million.  They really missed an opportunity of a lifetime!\n",
      "The 1960's really was the Silver Age of Comic books.\n",
      "Being born in the early 1960's, I remember pestering mom when we went into town to let me get a comic book.  It seems to have had a resurgence of late.  Did you know that Marvel created a blue ear superhero for a 4-year old boy who was uncomfortable wearing his necessary hearing aid.  The boy told his mom superheroes don't wear hearing aids.  That was really an amazing gesture from Marvel Comics!\n",
      "Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker lived an ordinary life as an orphan in the comic.\n",
      "How Stan lee dreams up this stuff is amazing.  Peter Parker is an orphan who gets bit by a radioactive spider to get his spider abilities!  Did you know that Stan Lee hyphenated Spider-Man so that he would not be confused with Superman?\n",
      "He can climb walls and shoot spider webs.  Sometimes I wish I could do that.\n",
      "Those are interesting superpowers, but I rather the Iron Man suit.  Spider-man made a brief appearance in the third Avengers movie.  \n",
      "The Marvel characters have superpowers, but are written as human, too.  Peter Parker had to deal with issues of adolescence and finance.\n",
      "it sees that is the case with most of them.  Human issues with a superpower alter ego.  Did you know there was a Spider-Man Broadway musical?  It happened to be the most expensive Broadway production (75 mill) and had numerous delays and injuries.  At one time it closed because its injury insurance was canceled!\n",
      "The musical is probably worth more than the $25M that Sony could have paid for most of the Marvel franchise in 1998.\n",
      "True.  What I find amazing is the collector's market for both Marvel and DC comic books.  Did you know Marvel once published a generic comic book to trademark the names \"Super-Hero\" and \"Super-Villain\"?\n",
      "There is even a character shared by both Marvel and DC, whose purpose is to keep the comic universes separate.\n",
      "I heard about that.  I guess that is why DC Comics \"Superman\" and \"Wonderwoman\" are never part of Marvel's Avengers.   Did you know that Michigan State University has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world?  That must be Mecca for comic book readers and collectors!\n",
      "I wonder how far back their collection goes.  Comics appear to have originated in Japan in the 18th century.\n",
      "Supposedly comic books took off in the US and the UK in 1933 with the publishing of \"Famous Funnies\".  Famous Funnies was a reprint of a collection of newspaper comic strips with simple plots.  I am not quite sure when \"real\" comic books appeared with longer story lines of all genre and not restricted to humorous tones.\n",
      "Marvel has a history almost that long.  It started in the 1930's as Timely Publications.  In 1961 it acquired the Marvel name.\n",
      "They really have an impressive history.  But many of the founding creative geniuses have passed away.  Stan Lee died in November 2018.  Do you think they can keep the momentum going without the genius of Stan Lee?  Stan had an interesting eccentricity.  He ended each phone call not with good bye, but with \"Excelsior!\".\n",
      "Disney owns Marvel now.  If anyone can maintain a franchise, it's Disney.\n",
      "True.  Disney has kept George Lucas's creations, Star Wars and Indiana Jones, going strong for some time now.  Its interesting that Disney can't have big Marvel characters in their theme parks east of the Mississippi.  Apparently Marvel, prior to the Disney acquisition, gave those rights to Universal Studios.\n",
      "I'll be like Stan Lee, and end this conversation... Excelsior!\n",

      "trees are interesting, I didnt know they could change their gender\n",
      "I was just reading about the acer pensylvanicum that can switch from male to female.  Had you ever heard of that before??\n",
      "No, thats new for me, didnt know trees had a sex apparently this can be determined when they bloom\n",
      "I know! This particular tree is a striped maple found in the US and Canada. I wonder if that affects if they produce maple syrup  or not.\n",
      "I don't know but it sounds like it's a weird species, it can take a mere three weeks to bloom and can switch sexes, that must be a pretty unique capability\n",
      "Right.  Apparently it's triggered to switch from male to female if there's been damage done. I wonder why that would be??\n",
      "I think theres a lot to learn about this tree still, they arent sure why it can change sexes and I guess there a lot to learn about the tree, maybe info that will change how we view nature\n",
      "Not only that, but apparently the worry is that climate change will cause more damage, and make more females, and less males, which could be the end of the species.  That's sad.\n",
      "It is, specially if we dont know how to control that, maybe we will learn before its too late, not producing enough fruit can have consequences on the ecosystem as well\n",
      "On a lighter note, did you know it's illegal to own a rabbit in Queensland (presumably Australia) unless you are a scientist or have a magician's license!!  \n",
      "I didnt, thats interesting the emperor of Japan is a scientist I guess he can own a rabbit in Australia if he ever decides to leave power and go to live there\n",
      "LOL. I didn't know that. I do think rabbits are found in a lot of literature, especially fantasy literature, like Alice in Wonderland or Watership Down. \n",
      "So you like fantasy literature?  George R. R Martin is one of my favorite authors\n",
      "Trying to think if there are any rabbits in Game of Thrones LOL \n",
      " But seriously, who doesn't like fantasy lit?  I was surprised to find out it's a pretty modern genre, with most written since the 1960s.\n",
      "I cant recall any lol, and yeah, I cant believe its a modern genre I wouldnt know what to do without fantasy in my life,\n",
      "I read a lot of fairy tales when I was a kid.  Would they be classified as fantasy?\n",
      "Yeah I think they are, speaking of GOT, you know that George R.R Martin was unsure about putting dragons into the mix, good thing he did,\n",
      "No kidding. They make great TV.  But I would like to read his books, as well.  I imagine they're pretty good.  Have you read the books?\n",
      "Yes, they are as good as the series, more details in the books fantasy novels are great\n",
      "I read that one fantasy author named Peter Brett wrote his first book ON HIS PHONE while commuting. That's amazing!\n",
      "That is amazing! I guess he took advantage of that unused time commuting\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi there, do you like superhero movies?\n",
      "Not really. I find they have too much CGI. What about you?\n",
      "I like some of them like Spider-man. DO you know why there is a hyphen in the name?\n",
      "I have no idea why. Why not just one word? Other superheroes have names like that.\n",
      "Because Stan Lee did not want it confused with superman\n",
      "Ok, I see. I guess that makes sense. Stan the Man knew what he was doing.\n",
      "For sure, he was a legend. Did you know Marvel offered the rights of characters to Sony but they only bought Spiderman?\n",
      "I think they did not foresee the appeal of superheros to a public starved for entertainment. A mistake on their part.\n",
      "Yeah for sure, they could have made much more now. Do you know who did the voice of Madame web in the spiderman series back in the day?\n",
      "I have no idea. Madame Web? Don't know.\n",
      "Yeah it was actually Stan Lee's wife, Joan B. Lee\n",
      "I guess he chose her for the job. I never really watched the show. \n",
      "I see. The Spider-man musical is the most expensive production on Broadway\n",
      "A Broadway production of Spider-man? That's an odd choice. Not very typical. \n",
      "Yeah, I know. It cost $75 million and the music and lyrics were done by Bono of U2\n",
      "I guess there is a star factor there, but I would not want to risk my money on that investment. Too unusual. TV and movies are better for superheroes.\n",
      "Yeah I guess. Have you heard of the superhero named Access?\n",
      "No, I haven't. Is that Marvel or DC?\n",
      "It is the superhero that maintains the balance between the two and they both own it\n",
      "That's great! I guess they are frenemies of a sort. Well, I enjoyed chatting! Have a good night!\n",
      "Same her. Have a good one. \n",
      "\n",

      "I'm not a big comic fan and I've only seen the first Spider-man movie, but I'd like to see more of them.\n",
      "Do you like Captain crunch?\n",
      "The cereal? I liked the crunchberry kind when I was a little kid. Do you?\n",
      "Yeah, the cereal. Do you eat cereal?\n",
      "Nah, I usually eat a yogurt berry smoothie for breakfast. You?\n",
      "Hilarious! Do you like Michael Jackson?\n",
      "Not really. I mostly listen to 90s grunge and punk. I respect his skill as a musical artist though. Are you a fan of his?\n",
      "  I think MJ was the greatest musician ever. Do you agree?\n",
      "It's hard for me to rank artists in different genres, but in terms of technical skill and creativity he's definitely in the top rank. Re Spiderman comics, one reason he was so popular was that the older generation of comics only had teens as sidekicks to adults, and he was the first teen to be a superhero in his own right.\n",
      "WOW\n",
      "Yeah. I notice that in the old \"Greatest Generation\" era of comics the teen sidekicks were always about a head shorter than the adult superhero, kind of like Bud on Father Knows Best. Like they were trying to infantilize them.\n",
      "Have you ever read the first spider man?\n",
      "Nah, I've never been a much of a comics person, but I'd like to catch up on the movies. You?\n",
      "Yeah, me either. Did you see the movie Glass? \n",
      "I never heard of it to be honest. Was it good?\n",
      "It wasn't that good. I didn't like the end. They killed Bruce Willis' character. Let's just say, he didn't \"Die Hard?\"\n",
      "I've never seen that one either, LOL. I guess I should, since it's such a big part of pop culture.\n",
      "Nice. Did you know DC comics paid $130 for the rights superman? \n",
      "I only read that recently. That's amazing. I'm not a believer in copyright in the first place, but paying that little for a copyright that you can used to keep the creators from using their own ideas is especially awful.\n",
      "Hilarious, did you know google purchased the domain gmail?\n",
      "I thought they originally owned it because it was a Google application.\n",
      "Yeah, that is crazy! Well nice chatting with you!\n",

      "I find science fascinating. How about yourself?\n",
      "I do too! Ezspecially natural science.\n",
      "Were you aware that the emperor of Japan is a scientist and still publishes papers?\n",
      "I had no idea! How fun. The world wide web was invented by a scientist too. I always thought it would have been an engineer.\n",
      "That is interesting. I would have thought the same. It's strange to me that the term scientist wasn't even coined until 1833. I wonder how they referred to previously?\n",
      "Maybe they were just called Philosophers? Have you seen where they put the picture of the horse on DNA? I saw it the other day on the news!\n",
      "That's possible. I did see that. I don't understand how they fit that much data in DNA. \n",
      "Me either. It's astounding what can be done. Do you like to read? My fave is fantasy.\n",
      "I do like to read. As far as fantasy, I do respect Terry Pratchett and find him quite humerus. \n",
      "It's amazing to me what people can use fantasy for. Did you know they fantasy draft the National spelling bee? I was surprised!\n",
      "I did not. They will fantasy draft anything now it seems. When I mentioned Terry Pratchett, I just recently learned that he was knights due to his literature work. I'm glad he received that honor. \n",
      "I had no idea. I haven't read much of his work, but my son loves his lit. \n",
      "I have read some and he is great. Since you mentioned fantasy drafting earlier, people also draft members of congress. \n",
      "I did not know that! Did you know people were writing fantasy novels in the 2nd century? I was reading about that the other day!\n",
      "I did not. Wow, fantasy has a very long history. I do love Game of Thrones. Apparently George RR Martin was hesitant to include the dragons but someone convinced him. I am thrilled that they did. \n",
      "I loved GOT. I wonder if the books are better then the show? \n",
      "I decided not to read them. I have friends that did and they said that he is way too descriptive. He will have a whole section describing the food at a dinner. I'll stick to the show. Just as a side note, it was a person named Phyllis Einstein that convinced him about the dragons. \n",
      "Oh really? The dragons were fun. I found it hard to keep up with the show sometimes. I felt like Martin had us all over the place for a fantasy.\n",
      "It does get complicated. I love the intrigue though. I am amazed that the longest work of fantasy is three million words long! That's insanely long. \n",
      "That is a lot of writing. I once heard a janitor in Chicago wrote a 15,000 page manuscript, but i have never seen it. He must have been writing for awhile.\n",
      "I wish he would have shared it. He potentially could have had a lucrative career. \n",
      "I would love to read it. I guess he did a lot of illustrations in it too. \n",
      "I would love to see that. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi how are you? are you interested in fantasy?\n",
      "Hello! I'm doing great! I am to a point haha how about you?\n",
      "I know a little about the genre. I read fantasy lit when I was younger. Tolkien. You?\n",
      "Same here! I'm interested in what this fantasy congress is though!\n",
      "I guess for political junkies and policy wonks, it is a lot of fun. for me? no.\n",
      "Me neither haha. I want to read that fantasy novel that was written in the 2nd century! It talked about the moon, aliens, and war between planets. My mind is blown!\n",
      "Wow. that is quite imaginative. i wonder who wrote it. that is amazing!\n",
      "I'm still in shock people thought of that back then. It does make me believe in aliens haha. I don't know if I have time to read the longest work of fiction ever though.\n",
      "Is that the one by the janitor?\n",
      "No but close! This one had 3 million words in it!\n",
      "That is insane. I wonder how long it took to write that many words.\n",
      "I don't even want to know I would be so bored haha. Are you into science at all?\n",
      "I like science. i enjoyed it in high school. You?\n",
      "Same here. There was only one scientist that has walked on the moon which is nuts!\n",
      "I think the astronauts are selected from a pool of pilots. not a whole lot of pure scientists there. in the future that could change.\n",
      "I hope so because I feel they put all the work in!\n",
      "Yes the scientists and engineers dont get to enjoy the fruits of their labor! Maybe Elon can change things.\n",
      "I hope so! That's cool that Japan's emperor is a scientist! We need minds like that in more in control of society!\n",
      "There will be a new emperor in Japan this year. Yes, we need more scientists and people trained in science. Anyway, great chat!\n",
      "Great chat to you as well, have a good night!\n",
      "Have a good night!\n",
      "Thanks!\n",

      "Did you happen to watch Deadpool 2? I thought it was so funny!!\n",
      "I haven't seen it yet.  I hear it's funny, but not very family friendly.  Is that true?\n",
      "Not at all family friendly, it has a lot of blood and material that its not appripiate for the family.\n",
      "Are there a lot of big names in the movie other than Ryan Reynolds?\n",
      "Not really, not that I know of but there some cool characters like Cable and Colossus.\n",
      "I used to be a big comic book fan and Colossus was one of my favorites!  Is this the movie that introduces the team X-Force?\n",
      "Yes its the team that introduces the X-Force, you know the video game actually had a higher cost to make than the movie.\n",
      "That is really interesting and I hope the game was worth it!  Are you a fan of comic books at all?\n",
      "I am a fan of comic books, its sad Stan Lee died.\n",
      "At least he lived a long, productive, and successful life!  I am also a fan of comic books, but it is an expensive hobby and I stopped collecting a while ago.\n",
      "He did, he ended every phone conversation with the phrase excelsior, and I can see why its expensive although it can also be considered as an investment.\n",
      "I guess if I am able to drive to Michigan State University in East Lansing, I can read what I want without costing an arm and a leg.  Their library has the biggest comic book collection available to the public!\n",
      "Thats a great idea I bet they have a lot of interesting comincs in there, do you also like DC comics?\n",
      "I do.  I used to be all about Marvel when I was younger, but I got into DC later. What about you?\n",
      "I do like them as well, DC comics is called Detective Comics, I didnt know that.\n",
      "Ha!  So Detective Comics Comics!  :)  You mentioned Stan Lee earlier.  Although the creator of Marvel Comics, he actually wrote 15 DC comics!\n",
      "Wow I didnt know that, I bet those comics are pretty good, I wonder if there are available at the Michigan State University.\n",
      "They might be a good place to start!  I guess not all superheroes are in comics, because I heard the US is home to 300 registered superheroes.\n",
      "So many superheroes! there is a superhero called normalman, I bet he is a lousy superhero lol.\n",
      "I can't imagine he has a lot to offer, but it sounds sort of interesting.\n",
      "He has a hard job though, he lives on a planet that's full of superheroes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello!  Did you see the movie Deadpool 2?\n",
      "Yep, I loved it! Apparently so did a lot of people because it's one of the few R-rated movies to be among the highest grossing of all time.\n",
      "Nice!  I didn't know that.  The Deadpool video game cost more to make than the movie!\n",
      "I never even knew there was a video game ha ha. Have you played it? Did Ryan Reynolds voice the mystery villain like he did in the film?\n",
      "I never played it.  I'm not sure if he did.  Ironically in the 2001 comic book Deadpool described himself as \"Ryan Reynolds crossed with a shar-pei\".  That led Reynolds to believe he was destined to play the role.\n",
      "He was destined to play the role since the Deadpool character was butchered in that X-Men movie. Destiny required they do the character justice this time.\n",
      "lol  Do you read comic books?  I haven't read them since I was a kid.\n",
      "I really only read manga and Alan Moore comics sometimes. Did you know they've been around in Japan since the 18th century??\n",
      "My one son is a huge Manga fan.  I remember one of the first book series he was into when he was younger was One Piece.  I had no idea they've been around since then.  I know the first modern comic book in the US came out in 1933.\n",
      "One Piece is great! You should look into it. It gets better after the first few chapters. And isn't that comic called Famous Funnies?\n",
      "I have no idea! LOLOL  I had enough of a time trying to figure out buying One Piece books for him.  That was all so new to me.  Didn't understand the genre.  Was a big learning curve for me. lolol\n",
      "Ha ha, I can understand that. If you were a superhero, you'd be normalman! Apparently he's an actual superhero ha ha.\n",
      "haha.  Good stuff!  There are over 300 registered superheroes in the US.\n",
      "We should go an register too. You ever heard of One Punch Man? You can be Genos and I'll be Saitama. We'll be the best out of those 300 for sure.\n",
      "Nice!  My son would love that I'm sure.  haha I'll have to look up One Punch Man.  When I grew up we had Garfield comics. lol\n",
      "Ah, the classic that is Garfield. He became a superhero once. He formed the pet force! Now, that would be a weird comic to read.\n",
      "Yes.  I think that came along after my time as well. LOL  I just googled One punch man.  My son loves those japanese anime shows like that as well.  \n",
      "Your son sounds like a cool cat yo. But is he as cool as Stan Lee and say \"excelsior\" to end his phone calls??\n",
      "LOL That's great!  I just learned that DC from DC comics stands for Detective Comics. I had no idea.\n",
      "The more you know, I tell ya. Did you also know that Stan Lee wrote for DC as well? Now that is one heck of a shock to me.\n",
      "I did not know that either! lol I'm way behind the times.  It's been a real pleasure chatting with you.  Thanks for giving me good thoughts about my son!\n",
      "Same to you. Hope you and your son have a great day. Bye now.\n",

      "Hello my friend, Excelsior! What do you think of the article?\n",
      "I thought the article was amazing, i am a huge fan of Marvel and  comic books and was nice to read about them. how about you? what were your thoughts\n",
      "I got into the marvel universe with the movies, so I cannot comment on the comic books. But saying that I loved Deadpool and the how Ryan Reynolds is carrying the role.\n",
      "Did you happen to see Ryan Reynolds first appearance as Deadpool? i believe it was in wolverine origin movies. What i found most interesting was that the Video game cost more to make than the Movie (Deadpool)\n",
      "Yes, but I hated how it ended with him being weapon X and sewing his mouth shut! The character is known for his snarky humor, they wasted a great characters in that movie for e.g. Gambit. I didn't know about the video game that's an interesting thing to know. Were there any other X-force members in comics apart from what they have shown in the movie?\n",
      "There was a handful that was missing from X-Force but really the team is just comedic timing.\n",
      "I just read in the article that there was comic with Garfield & his gang as Pet Force. That got a chuckle out of me imagining Odie as a super powered dog. Do you like Garfield comic strips?\n",
      "i can only imagine Garfield eating his way through problems and Odie fixing everything \n",
      "Haha, That's true and poor Jon would be pulling his hair out. Just a question, did Marvel do comic books series like DC's Elseworlds?\n",
      "Marvel does so many comic and there was so many topics back in the 70s and 80s im sure that they would have anything. Just last week Marvel released a League of Legends themed comic with Riot Games\n",
      "Wow, the more I get to know about this stuff the deeper it goes. It's interesting to note that Michigan state university library has the largest comic book collection publicly available in the world.\n",
      "Yes, i found that extremely interested and i wished i would have known that sooner as i no longer live in the region i would have spent a good deal of time there. but what i did find funny was that DC mean detective comics.  but they go by DC comics\n",
      "That would have been great, right? All the comic books you wanted to read. Yes, the DC & Comics again seems redundant, What did you think of Zazie beetz as Domino I think she got the role right with her attitude as happy go lucky survivor.\n",
      "She did do the role very well. but i think what really got me was you had both Josh Brolin, played Thanos and Cable and if the MCU every does a crossover it be weird\n",
      "Haha True that, I used to think what would happen if Fantastic Four(before the new rehash) did a cross over with Avengers who would Chris Evans play The Human Torch or Captain America? Ryan Reynolds as Green Lantern would probably never do a cross over with Deadpool universe but the end credits scene put a bullet in it literally.\n",
      "well it would be captain America for sure, though i heard that Deadpool will no longer be making another sequel but maybe make one more movie as Xforce \n",
      "Yeah, I am like waiting to see how End Game Pans out. But I thought the X-Force was dead with all of them in chunks literally. Though I would love to see a Wolverine & Deadpool team up if possible. \n",
      "Wolverine and Deapool team up would be cool but really just want to see a Hulk VS film the animated short films are amazing and seeing a Hulk VS Deadpool would be fun with the merc with a mouth\n",
      "It really is sad to see copyrights marring such great ideas of having Super-heroes or super-villains team up. I loved how they tried to include the Planet Hulk timeline in Thor:Ragnarok but I think a Standalone film would be better to connect  with the character.\n",
      "yes agreed, but i would highly reccommend the animated series when watching some of the Marvel Universe as they are able to do so much more without the copyright restrictions as oppose to live action. but one thing for sure is i definite need to do more research on \"Normalman\" that would be a fun read\n",
      "I would have to check that out too, and Normalman sounds fun I would also check that out.\n",
      "Yep between Normalman and the female reimaginations of the Marvel universe would be good. but a live action film with a multiverse would be cool like the new animated spiderman would be next level and interesting. \n",
      "Let's not get into the multiverse right now, it's too huge for my mind to comprehend right now! But I have been hearing great things about the new spiderman I didn't get to see it yet.\n",
      "Yes the new spiderman is basically done my marvel with Sony's permission. RDJ is in there\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you watch Deadpool?\n",
      "Yes I like the first Deadpool a lot. The second one I didn't think was as good but I did like Josh Brolin as cable, what did you think\n",
      "I did not watch the first deadpool but enjoyed the second. I have heard the first was better so maybe better that I watched the second one first so I don't get disappointed haha! Some people think Deadpool 2 was funnier though and I do like comedy.\n",
      "Well you should see them both because they are both pretty good. I do like the first one a lot more. It's a lot more tongue and cheek. Also, I can't believe that they didn't bring the first director back, they should have definitely done that it may have been a better movie\n",
      "Did you ever read the comics? Hardcore comic fans seemed to lament the inconsistencies between the comics and the films.\n",
      "I'm not that into Comics so it doesn't bother me, but I guess it would bother some people, did you ever play the Deadpool video game by the way? I did it's really good\n",
      "I am not too into video games. The video game cost more than to make the movie!\n",
      "That's very impressive! And yes the video game was awesome like I mentioned, also the movie is the highest grossing R-rated film of all time, if you don't include movies directed by James Cameron or George Lucas\n",
      "I thought it was a really unique film, quite different than the other superhero films because it was just for adults, and rated R, not PG 13.\n",
      "Yes I agree. It was a breath of fresh air, you should also know that Ryan Reynolds does the voice of the mystery Villain at the end of Deadpool 2, I'm not ruining anything for you though haha\n",
      "In a 2004 comic Deadpool described himself as Ryan Reynolds crossed with a shar-pei, so Reynolds thought he was destined for the role.\n",
      "That is really funny! I'm glad they were able to get Ryan Reynolds in the movies then, do you read any other comic books by the way?\n",
      "I don't really. I tried to get into them when I was in 3rd grade because it was trendy in my school. I just found out that the dc from dc comics makes it redundant!\n",
      "That is crazy! and you're right, DC stands for Detective Comics so you're saying Detective Comics twice that's hilarious\n",
      "Have you heard of Marvel's generic comic book? It was published in order to trademark super-hero and super-villain.\n",
      "No I didn't hear about that. I'll have to check it out it sounds interesting. I also want to check out the library at Michigan State University, they have the worlds largest publicly available comic book collection\n",
      "I wonder if they have any comics containing normalman.\n",
      "I'll have to check it out! What do you think about Stan Lee by the way? He was such an icon and would end every phone call with the word Excelsior lol\n",
      "I didn't know much about him but yes, he is certainly iconic. His legacy will live on for a long time!\n",
      "Yes I agree.  what other superheroes do you like? speaking of hinm too, Stan Lee wrote about 15 DC Comics which I didn't know about\n",
      "I like The Punisher, maybe because he's kind of \"normal-ish\"\n",

      "did you know there are over 300 superheroes registered in the usa?\n",
      "Hello!  Interesting, I wonder how one registers and what the role entails?\n",
      "that is a good point, to be honest im surprised it's so low you'd think there would be haha\n",
      "With as many comic book fans as there are, I'm surprised there isn't more too.  Do you read or like comic books?\n",
      "well I did when I was a kid a little bit, I looked at a comic shop recently and comics are like 5-7 dollars, and theyre kinda short you can finish them in 10 minutes, so It seems like theyre not worth it to me, what about you?\n",
      "I was similar except that I had a few years when the DC re-launched their \"New 52\" of trying it out again.  I mostly stuck with digital comics, but it was a very expensive hobby and I couldn't stay with it.\n",
      "it is expensive, I get why, it's a lot of work to draw and come up with stories and print everything, but ya it just doesn't seem like its worth the money to me, also funny is theres a superhero called normalman, he lives on a planet of superheroes and is the only one without a power haha\n",
      "I wouldn't want to be that guy! LOL.  Did you have a preference between Marvel or DC when you used to read comics?\n",
      "well I liked xmen as a kid, now that i'm older I like batman the best but thats the only DC character I like, below him would be xmen, spiderman, etc I think marvel has more characters that I like but batman is my favorite, you?\n",
      "I was pretty much all Marvel, with a couple exceptions when I was younger, and then became all DC the second time around.  It's funny I didn't realize DC Comics was like saying Detective Comics Comics.  \n",
      "haha no I didn't know that either, kind of like how gmail.com was originally purchased from a garfield forum because thats what the name gmail was based on\n",
      "You learn something knew every day.  Even Garfield had his own superhero series called \"Pet Force\" so I guess we all have the chance to be a superhero.\n",
      "haha thats true, I wonder if that is one of the registered superheroes, also didn't know stan lee wrote 15 dc comics\n",
      "It seems odd, almost traitorous, doesn't it? \n",
      "haha it does, I guess he reimagined batman and superman in terms of how he would change them, which sounds cool I'm going to look that up\n",
      "If you are near East Lansing and can stop by Michigan State, they might just have those as they have the largest publicly available collection in the world.  I wonder if he gave sort of a \"Marvel\" spin to the DC characters. \n",
      "oh wow, well I do live in Michigan, I'll have to check that out sometime, can't believe I didn't know that actually haha\n",
      "That's funny.  I'm in Nebraska and not as close.  For fun I looked up if we had any registered superheroes and it didn't appear so!\n",
      "ah well that's too bad, maybe you should be the first person to make a registered nebraskan superhero!\n",
      "Too bad there is a \"Normalman\" somewhere in the multiverse of ours. :)\n",
      "haha ya, I don't know maybe just Mr. Nebraska will have to do haha\n",

      "Hi Turker, do you like superhero movies, if yes, do you have a favorite hero?\n",
      "I like spider-man and I am interested in Deadpool but I haven't seen it.\n",
      "My favorite superhero is the Incredible Hulk, I haven't seen Deadpool either, but wonder how good is the movie.\n",
      "It is the highest grossing R-rated film of all time not directed by James Cameron or George Lucas.\n",
      "Oh, I heard It is very funny. Have you seen Avengers: Infinity War?\n",
      "No, I heard the movie was different then the comic though.\n",
      "I saw X-Men, I like the entire movies, my favorite is Wolverine and Iron Man.\n",
      "Back to deadpool, it took ryan reynolds 11 years to get his vision of deadpool made. That is a long time.\n",
      "Yes it is, so that much mean that he was thinking about this movie for 11 years?\n",
      "That is impressive. That makes a great actor.\n",
      "Yes it does, are you a fan of comic books, if you are, how many books do you have?\n",
      "I am not. But appears that their is a lot of money in the industry.\n",
      "Yes, you are right, I have lots of comics books, I am not a reader, I like them for the drawing of the characters.\n",
      "That is interesting. Dc comics paid $130 in 1938 for exclusive rights to superman. \n",
      "Yes, Superman and Archie rich are two of the most valuable book I heard of according to my knowledge. \n",
      "I think its funny that marvel comics spent 10 years convincing the US governement that x men are not humans. \n",
      "That's true, I didn't know that Deadpool was made just to make people laugh, I am not used to seeing superhero comic movies.\n",
      "I agree. I cannot believe that there are at least 30 superhero movies set to be released between 2016-2020.\n",
      "Wow that's a lot, did you see Black Panther, If yes, did you like the movie?\n",
      "I did not see it. Did you?\n",
      "Yes, I saw It twice, But I didn't like it, because the actor who played the black panther won so many awards, I think the other actor, I forgot his name, deserved those awards. \n",
      "Nice talking to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey, did you see the new Deadpool 2 movie? It came out this year.\n",
      "No.  I was surprised to find out it was R rated and not only that the highest grossing r rated film not directed by james cameron or george lucas!\n",
      "Yes, that surprised me too. Did you know the movie cost less to make than did the video game?\n",
      "Nope.  Didn't know that!  To be honest I'm not into superhero stuff although I do like the fact there is a super hero NormalMan!\n",
      "Wow, that is intriguing. There are over 300 superheroes which are registered in the US!\n",
      "Yes.  I was deprived as a child, my mother wouldn't have comic books in the house.  As an adult I find the graphics mixed with the words jarring.  I don't read manga either.\n",
      "Oh I see. Yeah, I was never as into comic books either. However I find them interesting. Do you know what the dc stands for in dc comics?\n",
      "Yep, it stands for detective comics.  I think that aspect is what got my mother so opposed to them.\n",
      "I see. Yeah, it's kind of interesting since dc comics is a bit redundant. Did you know Michigan State University contains the biggest publically available collection of different comic books?\n",
      "I read that somewhere.  I wonder if they allow people to look at them or if they are microfished or digitalized?\n",
      "I don't know. I'd want to find that out. What do you think of having Ryan Reynolds in the lead role in Deadpool? He seems like a good fit.\n",
      "Not having seen the movie, or knowing the storyline beyond the bare basics, I can't say.  What did you think?\n",
      "I think he is excellent. The screenwriters said he also voiced the mystery villain.\n",
      "So pick a superhero name and a superhero power.  I'd be Reader Girl and my superpower would be knowing everything that had ever been written!\n",
      "I would want to be like the Invisible Man, so that I could get some peace and quiet whenever I wanted. Be great to \"disappear\" during meetings at work, too.\n",
      "Well, I can see some advantages to being invisible, but when you 'disappear a work they tend to fire you!\n",
      "True. Maybe I can change to a different universe. The marvel cinematic universe takes place in the earth -1999999. That seems like a fun place.\n",
      "Yes it does.  What would  your uniform/outfit be as a superhero?  I would wear glasses, have spiked hair, thigh high boots over leggings with a tunic.  I think maybe black with red accents.  My hair would be silver.\n",
      "I like blue and black. I'd want to wear something like from Yu-Gi-Oh. I would want silver hair, too, though.\n",
      "Copy cat!\n",
      "Well, you know what they regarding imitation. They had a garfield book spinoff called pet force, did you know about that?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "Good!  Are you a star wars fan?\n",
      "Cool, yes I am.  How about you?\n",
      "I do enjoy them, especially the original trilogy\n",
      "Me too, those are the best.  Do you have any of the memorabilia?\n",
      "I dont.  You?\n",
      "Yes, I still have my original lunch box with thermos from when I was a kid.  It's banged up some, but I'd never part with it!\n",
      "That is awesome.  I still have some things from my childhood I cant part with too, like my glow worm.  \n",
      "Ahh!  that's so sweet!Merchandising has always been really big for Star Wars.  You know it holds a Guinness world record for most successful film merchandising franchise.  Pretty impressive!\n",
      "It is.  Star Wars is legend.  It was spanned so many years!\n",
      "That's a fact.  Did you realize that James Earl Jones only spent 2 1/2 hours recording his Darth Vader lines and only got paid $7500.00?\n",
      "That is nuts!  That voice is so iconic.  Do you know Marcia Lucas is behind a lot of  the films main scenes?\n",
      "I had heard that before and that she had actually won the Academy award for editing, while George did not for directing!  Wonder how he feels about his ex wife?\n",
      "I dont know, some break ups are amicable, she did help out a lot with the movies from what it seems like.\n",
      "Well, that's true! I still can't believe 20th Century Fox thought it was going to be a flop!\n",
      "I know, didnt Harrison Ford not want to be credited initially because he though it would not do well.\n",
      "Boy, many people had that all wrong!\n",
      "They really did here we are almost 50 years later and it is still going strong!\n",
      "That's my childhood!  It shocks me to see that the value of the Star Wars franchise is $65 billion!\n",
      "And that makes it only the 5th highest grossing media franchise.  I wonder what beat it?\n",
      "Yeah, it makes you wonder?  Well, it's been nice chatting with you this morning.  I've got to head into work.  Hope you enjoy the rest of your day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you like Star Wars?\n",
      "Yea I like the original trilogy. Apparently The Force Awakens was selected to be locked in a vault on Shutterfly \n",
      "Frozen was not too far behind, haha.\n",
      "Yea, I guess younger people don't find The Force Awakens that interesting and prefer Black Panther\n",
      "Interesting. I haven't watched Black Panther or The Force Awakens. Have you watched both?\n",
      "I've saw some of Black Panther, couldn't get into it. I heard Get Out was good\n",
      "I havent watched that either. I guess the only one I have watched is Frozen. The song is quite catchy. Before Let it Go was written, Elsa was the villain in Frozen. Because the song was uplifting, they changed her character.\n",
      "Yea, I'm surprised Frozen was the first female directed Disney animation, I figure there would be one sooner\n",
      "It's interesting that they did not want to call it Snow Queen because feminine titles don't perform as well.\n",
      "Yea I don't think the title \"Snow Queen\" would have stopped it from grossing a billion at the box office\n",
      "The writer of Let it Go has won an emmy, grammy, oscar, and a tony. he knows his stuff!\n",
      "Yea, Robert Lopez is pretty talented, he also co wrote a South Park episode\n",
      "Interesting! I really should watch more movies for myself and quit watching them with my kids. I have been meaning to watch Black Panther.\n",
      "Yea, apparently the Black Panther character is the richest superhero worth 500 billion\n",
      "Yeah, it's suprising Tony Stark is only worth $100 billion.\n",
      "Yea and Bruce Wayne is only worth 80 billion \n",
      "Black Panther was going to be called Black Leopard at one point. I wonder if it would have been as popular if it kept that name.\n",
      "Lol I don't know. I also never knew the Black Panther comic predates the Black Panther party\n",
      "Yeah, I was wondering if it had anything to do with the Black Panther party.\n",
      "Yea, apparently Denzel Washington funded Chadwick Boseman tuition for an oxford university theater program, that's nice\n",
      "The was really cool of him. Over 20 years later Boseman thanked him in person.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you see the force awakens?  It came out in December of 2015.\n",
      "Hello there, I did, I thought it was pretty good.  How about yourself?\n",
      "I loved it! I am a huge star wars fan. JJ abrams did a fantastic job on the score.\n",
      "Yeah I thought he did really well.  And, I know how tough it is to take on a Star Wars project, the fans are really intense. \n",
      "It is the 35 and over crowd that supports star wars.\n",
      "Yeah that is true, I guess only 32% of people between 25 and 34 saw the film. \n",
      "That age bracket preferred black panther to star wars.\n",
      "Yeah i read that as well, did you see the Black Panther film?\n",
      "I did not. I'm not really into the marvel and dc comics films. I fell off that genre way before the 18th film of black panther.\n",
      "Yeah I did not see it either, but I would if I had the chance.  I don't watch any of the Marvel movies except for the Xmen films I have seen some of those. \n",
      "Black panther is worth 500 billion, way more than tony stark's 100 billion.\n",
      "Yeah I was surprised they made a superhero more wealthy than Stark and Bruce Wayne. \n",
      "George Lucas is so talented and began star wars in 1977. I wonder what his net worth is.\n",
      "Yeah that was some creation, I wonder what he thought he was starting way back when. \n",
      "James earl jones must have had no idea because his pay was only 7500 for voicing vadar.\n",
      "Yeah, but when you read how long it took him to do it, I would say thats some pretty good dough per hour!\n",
      "That's true! Those movies are so good and deserving of their 8.5 billion box office.\n",
      "Yeah they are, do you have a favorite of all of the Star Wars films?\n",
      "Empire strikes back from 1980 is my favorite to re-watch. How about you?\n",
      "Yeah, I would have to agree, I think me and you are like most people as well when we pick that one. \n",
      "It's a good choice! Nice meeting you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "HI, how are you? Do you like movies?\n",
      "I sure do! What's your favorite?\n",
      "I do like the Star Wars films from back in the day.\n",
      "They made awesome films for the time! Really groundbreaking.\n",
      "George Lucas was crazy! Crazy like a fox. He knew that there was money in them toys. \n",
      "Oh yea, they agreed to let him forgo $500 k in directing fees for licensing!\n",
      "Half a million was a lot of money in those days, but I guess he saw the long-term potential of the franchise. Now he is a billionaire.\n",
      "Wow, apparently James Earl Jones spent 2.4 hours recording the lines for Star Wars and was paid $7,500 (I wonder how much that is now?)\n",
      "Probably four or five that number. In 2013, Star Wars was dubbed in Navajo, making it the first major film to be dubbed in a native american language. I wonder if James had anything to do with that project.\n",
      "That's interesting, and kind of interesting thing NOT to do regularly.\n",
      "I don't know how many Navajo fans there are. George never won an Oscar though.\n",
      "that's sad considering how amazing his movies were\n",
      "The Academy has a lot of politics. He made the wrong kinds of films. His wife got an award. \n",
      "What did she get an award for?\n",
      "Oscar for editing. She helped shape the film too. A lot of plot points were her ideas.\n",
      "That's awesome! Have you seen Frozen or Black Panther?\n",
      "I haven't seen either. I know that BP was up for an Oscar. That was strange to me. A comic book film?\n",
      "I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but it certainly held my attention. I have a daughter who I thought would be a little too young at the time for Frozen. I was wrong, and now she loves it.\n",
      "That's great! I bet it has a lot of great songs too. I should see it. It was directed by a woman, yes?\n",
      "That's pretty cool! It does have strong female characters.\n",
      "That's good. Little girls need role models too. Anyway, I enjoyed chatting!\n",
      "You too!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a Star Wars fan? There are so many movies out that I can't keep track of them all.\n",
      "I do like them but haven't seen the new \"Solo: A Star Wars Story.\"  Have you?  What do you think of Hans Solo if you have?\n",
      "I haven't seen it either. I think that Disney will try to do a backstory movie on every character. \"R2-D2 and C3PO: two robots in love\"\n",
      "I like Harrison Ford.  He made Solo so loved.  His character was such a skeptic.\n",
      "Yeah, he balanced out the mumbo-jumbo of the Force. I wonder how he comes off in the new film. \n",
      "Did you realize that Al Pacino was chosen to take the part of Solo but he turned it down because he didn't understand the script?\n",
      "I bet he didn't. He really would have made a strange Solo. I know that Sean Connery was offered the part of Gandalf but said no. Casting is key to the success of a movie.\n",
      "Very true.  Christopher Walken was also considered by Lucas to do Hans Solo.  That would have made a difference too.\n",
      "A much darker, more brooding Solo with great dance moves. \n",
      "George Lucas' wife had a large impact on the movies too.  She won an academy award for editing the first Star Wars film.\n",
      "She got that Oscar that George never got! Oh well. He'll just have to be content to be a billionaire. I wonder what he does everyday besides count his money.\n",
      "Poor James Earl Jones at that time only made $7500 for recording all of Darth Vadar's lines in the original Star Wars.  It took him 2.5 hours.  I guess though that isn't too shabby when you think about it.\n",
      "Nobody really knew just how much money would be made. I bet the next movie paid handsomely. \n",
      "20th Century Fox thought he would flop.  They sure were wrong!\n",
      "That's how Lucas got the merchandising rights and the cash to set up Lucasfilm. He really gambled smart.\n",
      "I wonder if he'd agree with the theory that there is only one electron in the universe?  How does that explain all the universe of planets, stars, and galaxies?\n",
      "Only one electron in the universe? That sounds like a crazy theory! How come only one? Have you heard that the universe might be a hologram? Maybe we are just an entertainment system for some alien race.\n",
      "Sometimes it seems like that.  Can you imagine that you can actually touch some stars because their temperature is cold enough.  How do they burns so bright?  \n",
      "Fusion is the source of a star's energy. I think that if we harness the power of fusion in our lifetimes, many energy probes will disappear. Flying electric cars for everyone!\n",
      "I wonder if Lucas thinks about all these things when he films?  Interestingly, Star Wars was made dubbed in Navajo in 2013.  This was the first major film to be in that language.  Sounds like they have a lot more success to come.\n",
      "Star Wars could very well be the first series to have a sequel made on Mars. \n",
      "That sounds very interesting.  I wonder if Lucas has some connections there?  Lucas had originally wanted Hans Solo to be a large green alien so it's possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi Turker, have you seen the Star Wars movies, if yes, did you like it?\n",
      "i didn't like it. but harrison ford is cool. detached and ironic is how id describe his performance\n",
      "Yes I like harrison ford also, I saw return of the Jedi and he played his part well.\n",
      "they say he was skeptical about doing the film\n",
      "I wonder why, how did you like the actor Luke Skywalker in star wars, I remember you didn't care for Star wars, but just the actor.\n",
      "Hamill looked like a goof. i hear he didn't want to do the sequel\n",
      "Hahaha, strange, but I always like the show Star Trek since back in the days, did you ever watch the shows?\n",
      "I watched star trek. its more intellectual. I don't like these \"lord of the rings\" / \"game of thrones\" fantasy things...but Harrison ford and star trek are the exceptions\n",
      "Ok, did you know James Earl Jones spent only 2.5 hours recording all of darth vader lines for star wars and was paid $7,500 in 2013?\n",
      "he's got the voice. christopher walken's voice would've added some edge\n",
      "I didn't know that, don't you know that george lucas became a billionaire during the star wars movies.\n",
      "wow. luckily he didn't make solo a green alien as originally planned. else he'd be in the poor house\n",
      "Did you know that there are stars in the universe that cold enough to be touched by human hands?\n",
      "really. does that make the theory that the universe is a giant superhologram more or less likely?\n",
      "I am not sure but I would say more likely, there is a theory there is only one electron in the universe.\n",
      "well, if space is pulling galleries out of sight, how will we ever know?\n",
      "We may never know, I didn't know that AL Pacino turn down the role of han, he couldn't understand the script.\n",
      "maybe he should watch the navajo version.\n",
      "Al Pacino turned down the role, christopher Walken was considered the part of han solo in the star wars movie.\n",
      "well, james earl jones  made out well. 20th century too. they thought it would flop at first\n",
      "Yes that's true. When George Lucas was working on Star Wars, he initially wanted either a black actor or a large green alien to play Han Solo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a fan of star wars?\n",
      "Yes I am, I also like Harrison Ford, I think he is a great actor, what about you?\n",
      "I am as well! I cant believe how much money the series has made. Over 8.5 billion\n",
      "I know that is really surprising, but there are 4 others that make even more moeny.\n",
      "Thats still a lot of toy light sabers!\n",
      "I heard Marcia Lucas had a lot to do with some of  the great ideas of the series.\n",
      "Yeah she even won an academy award! Something George Lucas didnt\n",
      "Yeah I heard she won the award for editing the film, you know Star Wars was the first movie to ever be dubbed to Navajo?\n",
      "Thats really cool. I cant believe that Fox gave Lucas licensing and merchandising rights! All because they thought the film would bomb\n",
      "I bet they are regretting this choice and someone definetely got fired lol, It sure cost them billions.\n",
      "The franchise itself is worth $65 billion. \n",
      "I like that Star Wars explored the universe, although many things of the movie are fiction it made me wonder as a kid, you know that there are stars that are cold enough that can be touched with bare hands\n",
      "Thats crazy to think considering all the energy our own sun puts out\n",
      "I know, I guess that energy runs out eventually, what do you think about theory of the universe being a giant hologram\n",
      "I guess anything would be possible. Even the theory that there is only one electron in the universe\n",
      "I agree I am willing to keep an open mind after all theres a lot that we dont know about the universe\n",
      "Yeah and theres only an observable section that we can see. Who knows what else there is\n",
      "Yeah so back into the Star Wars topic, did you know that back in the day Al Pacino turned down the role of Han Solo\n",
      "Another possible regret. Unfortunate that he didnt understand the script. Christopher Walken was also considered\n",
      "I see, so Ford is actually lucky, you know Han Solo was a tie fighter  before he evenbecame the pilot of the millenium falcon.\n",
      "Yeah very lucky, he almost didn't get the part. Wasn't even allowed to audition at first.\n",
      "Thats surprising! I think he was perfect for the part, well the new movie is also good and it grosses about 393 million worldwide.\n",
      "\n",

      "I find fish to be very interesting. How about you?\n",
      "I do too, it's interesting that the seahorse is the only fish with a neck\n",
      "That is very interesting. Have you heard of the black swallower fish?\n",
      "Yea, the black swallower sounds lke a scary fish, it can eat prety twice it's length\n",
      "Yes and 10 times it's own weight. That's pretty terrifying. I wonder how it digests that?\n",
      "I'd like to know too. Did you know a zebrafish shares 84 percent of genes associted with human disease? They must be used for research if true\n",
      "I did not. I agree that we must really study them further. Another that I would like to see studied it the jellyfish because some of them are immortal. We need to find out how and why that's possible. \n",
      "The immortal jellyfish sounds like something from a science fiction novel. I wonder how long the oldest one has lived?\n",
      "That's a very good question. If they do not get disease or injured they will never die so I wonder if there is an ancient one out there somehow. \n",
      "That be pretty funny if there was an immortal Jellyfish that has been stinging humans since ancient Egypt\n",
      "That would be funny. Do you know how freshwater and saltwater differ in how they consume water?\n",
      "Yea, apparently freshwater fish drink through there skin by osmosis and salt water fish just drink through their mouths, I'd would think it would be the other way around\n",
      "You would think that. It's very interesting. Off topic but do you enjoy Disney films?\n",
      "I loved the lion king, it was the first disney movie to be dubbed in Zulu\n",
      "I'm glad that they did that so others could enjoy it. Did you know that the first animated Disney film directed by a woman was Frozen? It seems like that took far too long. \n",
      "Yea it does, you'd figure with all the movies disney has made there would be a female directed on way before Frozen came out\n",
      "I agree. Have you ever noticed identical scenes in any Disney movies especially those from the 70's?\n",
      "Yea, I've seen videos on youtube that show the identical scenes that Disney recycled from the 70s\n",
      "It's because during that decade they recycled a lot of their frames. I wonder if that was budgetary of time concerns?\n",
      "Possibly. Did you know Wreck-it-ralph stared development all the way back in the 1980s?\n",
      "I did not. I'm actually glad they took longer to make it though because they got to add so many other cool characters that would not have existed yet. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, have you seen the new A Wrinkle in Time? Oprah is in it.\n",
      "Actually, I haven't but I have read the original novel by Madeleine L'Engle way back when I was in elementary school. \n",
      "That is a good book. This new movie is done very well, especially the young actress, Storm, who plays Meg. \n",
      "Yeah, I've read she really felt a bond with the character.  And really related to her on several levels.\n",
      "I was surprised to find that Meryl Streep's first role was in a sports movie.\n",
      "Hey that's pretty neat!  Did you know she also speaks fluent Italian?\n",
      "I did not, I know her daughter plays an FBI robot on a series.\n",
      "Yeah, some Italian producer called her ugly (in Italian) when she was auditing for King Kong (1976) and she surprised him by responding in his language!  That had to be embarrassing, huh?\n",
      "That would have been hilarious. She's been nominated for 18 academy awards, she's awesome.\n",
      "Yeah, it's weird though, she's been nominated 18 times, but only won 3 times.  Most have been some stiff competition or something.\n",
      "Politics, lol. It even inflates awards. I never knew her middle name was Louise, that's my grandmother's name.\n",
      "Oh, that's awesome!  Speaking of awards, she's also received 31 Golden Globe nominations and won eight.  That's a lot of awards!\n",
      "Frozen was the first Disney film to be directed by a woman. it's about time they become more inclusive.\n",
      "Really?  Huh.. could have sworn Brave had been co-directed by a woman... or maybe it was just co-written by one, I can't remember... (I'm getting old.. lol)\n",
      "I am too, lol. I cannot believe Disney actually recycled some of their animation frames, I wonder if the artists receive royalties on those movies?\n",
      "Yeah, I saw a youtube video about that.. they recycled, for example a \"dancing\" scene in Snow White for their Robin Hood cartoon.  Did you know the toy industry gets involved in Disney animations before the film production even begins?\n",
      "That is so insane. So is taking three decades to make Wreck-It-Ralph, and I still don't think it's a good movie.\n",
      "AHHHH blasphemy!  I loved Wreck It Ralph!  Ahh, well, to each is own, I guess.  Did you know Lion King is the first film to be dubbed in Zulu?\n",
      "I did. That is amazing. Thanks for chatting with me, have a wonderful day.\n",
      "Hey, you too!  Hope the weather is good where you're at!\n",
      "Thanks, its not.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello\n",
      "Hi, do you like fantasy movies?\n",
      "Yes I do, Thanks\n",
      "\n",
      "I love disney movies, and Pixar too, do you remember the movie Wall e?\n",
      "Yes I do remember it, it was a good movie.\n",
      "I did not know but it looks like the name make reference to the fullname of Walt Disney Walter Elias Disney\n",
      "Yea I did not know that, but read it in Factual Section2\n",
      "Talking about names, do you know what is Minnie Mouse's full name?\n",
      "It is Minerva Mouse\n",
      "That is cute!! Do you know which movie took the longest time to produce?\n",
      "The Thief and the Cobbler took 31 years due to lack of funding and complexity of the animation.\n",
      "It has a record! It looks like the 101 dalmatians also had some money problems!\n",
      "It does, looks like they had to xerox some of the animation to save money\n",
      "But even though they kind of fell it lacks fantasy, I think they achieved a great result. It is one of my favorites!\n",
      "Yes I agree, I would not consider 101 dalmations a fantasy movie\n",
      "Yes it is more realistic!, have you heard about how much money actors make signing autographs\n",
      "Yes, that is a crazy amount of money.  I didn't realized they got paid as much doing so.\n",
      "It is kind of a side job, but it gets more than their salary in some cases\n",
      "I wouldn'\n",
      "Did you know there has only been one fantasy movie to win an oscar?\n",
      "Sorry about my last response, accidently hit enter.  I was saying that I wouldn't mind having that side job.  I actually did know that LoTR was the only fantasy movie to win an Academy award\n",
      "hahaha that is ok! I would not mind that side job either!\n",
      "Thanks, it has been nice chatting with you\n",
      "Same here!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello! How are you today?\n",
      "I'm doing amazing how about yourself\n",
      "Same here! Are you into the fantasy drama at all?\n",
      "Yea stuff like game of thrones you mean?\n",
      "Yes and Lord of the Rings!\n",
      "Lord of the rings is a classic I think that long format influenced many of the films we see today.\n",
      "I agree with you on that one! It's the only fantasy movie to be up for and win a best picture award at the oscars!\n",
      "Who's your favorite character4 from lord of the rings mine is Legolas\n",
      "I would say it is Aragon because he did his best to protect everybody!\n",
      "Which is your favorite film of of the original trilogy?\n",
      "It is definitely the second one. I liked all the battle scenes and when Gandolf returns to lead the army to help fight. You?\n",
      "The 2nd is the best definitely the way the special effects were from a movie from that long ago proves how well made it was between LOR and harry potter both of those had amazing special effects\n",
      "Well said! Are you into Disney movies at all?\n",
      "Yes the lion king is one of my absolute favorites what about yourself?\n",
      "Me too! Do you know who the science consultant was for Flubber?\n",
      "No who was it, Robin williams was amazing in that film.\n",
      "Bill Nye the Science Guy haha.\n",
      "He's actually a big speaker now and proponent of education and science he's a great dude\n",
      "He's awesome! I never had a clue what Minnie Mouse's full name was! Anyways great chatting with you!\n",
      "Have a fantastic day my friend\n",
      "Thanks you as well!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you enjoy movies?\n",
      "YEah I do. I especially like Disney movies. How about you?\n",
      "Disney does a good job toning down stories yet making them still interesting\n",
      "I know they do. They have been a master of that since Roy and Walt Disney founded the company on october 16 1923.\n",
      "What disney film do you like most?\n",
      "Probably the lion king. I have always loved that one. Did you know that walt disney makes about 1110 dollars per second??\n",
      "I recently re watched some classics and it was nice. They are doing a good job with recent films like wall e too\n",
      "My son loves wall-e as well. Did you know that disney doesnt except outside ads. All the ads you see on disney are for there shows and products.\n",
      "They also have been updating their technology from hand to a 55k core supercomputer for rendering\n",
      "That is awesome. I bet it will make the movies even better. I guess Walt disney got fired rom a newspaper because he wasnt creative enough. I guessed they didnt see what everybody else sees.\n",
      "Well you could argue he is a visionary as he helped establish the company in american animation and theme parks\n",
      "I would agree with that. So what do you think about fantasy films?\n",
      "I enjoy it since it allows for world building with mythology and the supernatural\n",
      "It really does. I love the Harry potter movies. How about you?\n",
      "I really enjoyed the book as much as the film. I liked lord of the rings as well\n",
      "I heard that harry potter actually first appeared in the 1986 film troll. The director says that JK Rowling stole the idea from him.\n",
      "have you ever been to a fan convention for harry potter? I hear it is very lucrative for actors and authors\n",
      "I havent. It sounds fun though. Did you know that the actor who plays tyrian lannister in game of thrones is related to nobility in germany?\n",
      "Really? In real life?\n",
      "Yeas in real lie. The actors name is Peter Dinklage. He is a member of the westphalian noble family von dincklage.\n",
      "Not only a great actor, but also a great lineage\n",
      "That is true. He is my favorite actor in game of thrones. Well Im gonna have to be going. Have a good one.\n",
      "The same to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a fan of youtube?\n",
      "hi how are you? I do like youtube. i listen to old songs on there. very convenient and nostalgic.\n",
      "for sure, they have everything on there. It is the second most vistied search engine\n",
      "I think that youtube is owned by google, so they share search engine tech.\n",
      "kind of a monopoly on the search engine game, i get it. Were you into the gangnam style phase?\n",
      "No, i was not. i know that the song appeared in a super bowl commercial though.\n",
      "yea I remember that lol. The song almost broke youtube it was played so much. The counter wasn't set for that many people\n",
      "That is funny. i guess there were a lot of fans in korea. \n",
      "And a lot of americans loving that style too. I had to dance  it at a wedding once, scarred me for life!\n",
      "I do not dance, so i would have to avoid that song.Do you like Elon Musk?\n",
      "I like him for the most part, and for how he is investing in science and such. As a person he has some improvements to make. How about you?\n",
      "i think he is bright and ambitious and like most of us, has flaws. he tries things that other companies think are too risky.\n",
      "Right I love his space X vision. I would like to see people on mars before I die\n",
      "I think that will happen, but i would not want to be in that group of explorers.  Is he going to go himself?\n",
      "I am not sure, that would be crazy to go. Did you ever see Thank you for smoking, I never knew Elon was the producer and acted in that movie\n",
      "I liked that movie. I did not know that Elon was involved. I wonder why that film. Does he believe in it or something?\n",
      "I am not sure, I want to go back and watch it and point him out. His wife was even in inception, I want to watch that one also and see her\n",
      "I bet he meets all kinds of gals. he is an interesting guy. I will watch inception again and look for his wife.\n",
      "For sure, I may do it now lol! It was so nice chatting with you!\n",
      "I enjoyed chatting with you too! Have a good weekend\n",
      "you as well! \n",
      "\n",

      "YouTube is an American video sharing website created on February 2005.\n",
      "I watch a lot of videos on YouTube. Do you spend much time on there?\n",
      "One hour a week. How much did you spend time in it ?\n",
      "I usually spend about a half an hour a day. It's great entertainment for when I'm multitasking. What kind of content do you prefer on there?\n",
      "Comedy videos, sometime news or latest songs, cartoon videos. which is your favourite content ?\n",
      "I like music videos, vlogs, and TV shows. I enjoy mixing content that individuals create and upload with media corporations' content.\n",
      "You can upload the video also it is quite interesting. YouTube now operates as one of Google subsidiaries.\n",
      "I wonder how much money Google has made on the initial $1.65 billion acquisition of Youtube. It's such a popular site.\n",
      "It is very interesting. Youtube  is the second search engine on the net. We can search all type of video we needed. It is very useful to show our talent.\n",
      "It shares more than just talent, too. It also shares ideas and information about companies, like when Elon Musk's interview went viral on there.\n",
      "We can watch live videos also. It is very amazing. Elon Musk is a successful person.\n",
      "Elon Musk is very successful, and I think he knows he can utilize YouTube to make his company grow. The ability to record videos and stream live content on YouTube makes it very versatile.\n",
      "Elon Musk is a technology entrepreneur, he utilize the technology which reach the people as quick as possible to make ads for his products.\n",
      "Exactly! He is business-savvy enough to reach out to multiple audiences too, marketing cars through Tesla Inc. and crazy things like flamethrowers from the Boring Company.\n",
      "He is very interested in making solar panel and electric cars which are very good for environment. To reduce global warming and climate change.\n",
      "He has a lot of interest in his company's success as well, since he took a pay cut to his Tesla salary one year for all but $1!\n",
      "Tesla is American automotive and energy company, the company is specializes in electric car manufacturing.\n",
      "It sells three different car models right now - the Model S, Model X, and Model 3. I'd love to try driving one of them.\n",
      "The Tesla model is road tested on an indoor track because their car don't produce emission.\n",
      "The lack of carbon emissions is why it is supposed to be so environmentally friendly.\n",
      "Yeah. They are also manufacturing solar panel also, they know the use of renewable energy resources also. It is the future.\n",
      "I will be excited to see where Tesla goes, and I won't be surprised if I see news about them on YouTube. It was interesting talking with you about it!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you watch any of the new Holiday movies over the Christmas period?\n",
      "Hi! Yes, I did! So many, one of my Favorites however, is the classic Nutcracker! You can never go wrong with that. How about you?\n",
      "I did not see that one, my daughter will want to watch it though.  Maybe we'll wait to stream it next Christmas.\n",
      "Oh its, great. Im sure she will enjoy it. I didnt know Morgan Freeman was in it, he was great!\n",
      "I'd like to see that Bohemian Rhapsody movie too, probably not great, but it's fun to hear toe songs again.\n",
      "Oh, I havent heard of that one! Do you know who is in it?\n",
      "There's a Rami Malek, I know he's been on TV in a show called  Mr Robot.  There's not anyone famous, but the subject matter is, Queen the rock group.\n",
      "Oh! Im gonna have to check it out! I recently watched \"the thief and the cobbler\" did you know it took 31 years to complete?! Thats my entire life! \n",
      "Never heard of that one.  Why 31 years, just a slow worker or was the nature of the production that it had to take time?\n",
      "due to lack of funding and complex animation atleast it holds a record for the longest production time for a motion picture of all time... thats crazy. Do you enjoy Fantasy film?\n",
      "I don't mind them, I'm usually not too bothered by the genre of a movie, as long as it is good.  I enjoyed those Lord of the Rings movies.\n",
      "Me either, as long as its good. I like all movies, and I watched the Lord of the Rings too, they won an academy award for Best Picture, another good one was Harry Potter, did you watch that series of movies?\n",
      "Yes, I never read the book but my wife did, I used to go with her each time a new one came out.  I liked them and have re-watched them with the kids.\n",
      "Same here, my husband forced me to watch all of them too, I was reluctant at first but glad I did, not I enjoy them. I didnt know JK Rowlings was a woman! \n",
      "That I did know.  The publisher was concerned boys would not read her books if they knew it was written by a woman.  So they made her put JK on the cover rather than her name.\n",
      "Wow! thats brilliant yet sad she couldnt be herself. It takes alot of creativity. Did you hear about the Janitor in Chicago and his Art work?\n",
      "No, what did he do or make?  \n",
      "Its insane! he made a 15,145 fantasy manuscript with over 300 watercolor illustrations, he called it \"in the realms of the unreal\" it's amazing, Ive come across it before. it was found after his death\n",
      "That's dedication, I'll have to look that one up.  In the realms of fantasy there is Terry Pratchett and his novels.  He created this whole world over the span of about 50 books, each one adding new details and characters.  Some people are devoted to it.\n",
      "Wow, Im gonna have to look that one up later, I find it all facinating! I wish I would have known ther was an actual university where you can study science fiction and fantasy literature with Tolkien Studies, I love the weirdness. Do you Netflix?\n",
      "Yes we do, canceled our cable about a year back and now save about sixty dollars a year.\n",
      "Me too! Youtube and Netflix, thats all I need. Best decision Ive made, sadly lol JK. Fun chat!! Take care!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I had no idea DC was doing this. Do you enjoy DC?\n",
      "I do but not a big fan. I do love WOnder WOman\n",
      "I do too. I loved the WW movie from a few years back. I think a lot of companies are going this route with streaming services...\n",
      "Do you collect comic books?\n",
      "I do not. I just enjoy the movies and cartoons with my 7 year old. Do you?\n",
      "I do as well. I remember going to see Superman at the movies as a kid\n",
      "I was too young to see it, like 4 or 5, but I do remember being mad at my mom and dad for going without me... I was saddened with Christopher Reeves' accident and death. seemed like a little of my childhood was gone.\n",
      "Do you remember the tv version with George Reeves in it?\n",
      "I do not. I did love the Dean Kane version though.\n",
      "That one was my least favorite. \n",
      "I just liked Louis Lane... \n",
      "She got on my nerves in the older versions\n",
      "HA! I can see that. Did you read factual section 2? \"Superman was once bitten by dracula. but because the man of steel is fueled by the sun, dracula immediately exploded.\"\n",
      "That is silly. I found it odd that you can not name your own child Superman in some countries\n",
      "Right? Sweden... That's too bad because I was going to move there and name my next child Metallica\n",
      "My youngest's name is Ikea because of the store\n",
      "Too bad it wasn't JC Penny\n",
      "Who was your favorite nemesis in Superman? I loved lex luther\n",
      "I loved Lex Luther too! Now that I am thinking of Batman, I really loved the Adam West batman. I still watch it when it is on TV Land or similar channel.\n",
      "Yeah the old classic versions of these superheroes were always the best\n",
      "I remember thinking the bat cave was so cool growing up and now it's just a few boxes with flashing lights.\n",
      "DId you dress up with a cape too?\n",
      "No. I did not have a cape. I wish I did! I would have worn it every day!\n",
      "Comic heroes are big in Japan too\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey do you like comic books?\n",
      "I love reading them and used to collect them when I was younger. What about you?\n",
      "Yeah I mainly like Marvel. Apparently they published a generic comic book so they could trade mark super-hero and super-villian. \n",
      "That sounds like it didn't work very well in the long run. It hasn't kept other companies like DC Comics from creating their own superheroes and supervillains.\n",
      "I know right, it's strange that was even an option. DC actually stands for Detective comics. I didn't know that.\n",
      "It kind of makes the name \"Detective Comics Comics\" a little repetitive, doesn't it? Curious that they'd do that!\n",
      "They said to make the name redundant. So weird. I thought Stan Lee was an amazing human, did you like him?\n",
      "Stan Lee was like the grandfather of all comic books, at least in my mind. I wish I could have met him to tell him that, or even just to hear one \"excelsior\" myself.\n",
      "I would have liked to as well. I never thought about when the marvel cinematic universe took place, it takes place in earth-199999. Not sure what that means but it's a multiverse and different from the original earth-616.\n",
      "I think a multiverse means multiple universes can exist having the same characters, which is why there are different \"canon\" versions of the same superheroes. It's pretty typical in long-running comics.\n",
      "Oh that makes sense. Have you ever been to the Michigan state library? It has the largest comic book collection in the world.\n",
      "I haven't been there, but my uncle went to college there. Unfortunately, I don't think he cared about comics! Can you imagine the size of the collection? I'd get lost in there for days.\n",
      "Wow, that is cool! I wonder how many actually exist. \n",
      "Probably too many to read in one lifetime. You'd probably have to devote a decade just to Batman comics. They've made so many Batman TV shows and movies and haven't even come close to the number of comic book issues.\n",
      "I never really got into the Batman comics but I do love the movies.\n",
      "I always loved the classic TV show with Adam West, but that's partially nostalgia from growing up watching it. Which movies do you prefer - the Nolan ones, the new Justice League ones, or others?\n",
      "I enjoyed the animated series as well as some of the new ones, my kids and I enjoy Teen Titans Go! \n",
      "The classic animated series was fantastic. I haven't seen the newer ones, but I've only heard good things about Teen Titans. Can't say the same about the new \"Titans\" show, though.\n",
      "I heard about Titans not streaming on DC Universe's streaming service but haven't watched it. Have you seen it yet?\n",
      "I've only seen the trailers for Titan and to me they pushed the \"dark and edgy\" so far it made me cringe. I haven't heard many positive reviews either, so I'm holding off unless things start looking up.\n",
      "Oh well, maybe it'll be good, if not kids still have Teen TItans! Haha, well it was nice talking to you, I've gotta run now, bye!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When one thinks about the definition of the universe, one must include space and its contents, but also the dimension of time.\n",
      "Yes I agree. It's interesting that some scientists theorize that universes are subject to Natural Selection, kind of like how species evolve on Earth\n",
      "True.  It makes sense that when something cataclysmic occurs, something weaker is destroyed.  How about the theory that there is only one electron in the universe.  Surely that is not a serious theory.\n",
      "Yes I don't know about that theory, or the theory that the universe is one giant hologram, even though I know that's what Elon Musk believes\n",
      "I did not know that about Musk.  Also, the fact that there are stars cold enough for a human to safely touch them.  Surprising!\n",
      "I would definitely touch one of those Stars! Do you like Superman movies? Apparently he first made his appearance in the movies back in 1941\n",
      "I do like him as a character in movies.  I think those early films were animated.  Who is your favorite Superman actor?\n",
      "I think Christopher Reeve is the best Superman. I don't like whatever new guy they have right now. What about you? Apparently you can't name your son or daughter Superman in Sweden to LOL\n",
      "I also preferred Reeve.  I like the villain Brainiac too  The comic book writers coined that word.\n",
      "That is interesting because people still use that word a lot. Did you know Superman was bitten by Dracula once?\n",
      "No.  Did it have an effect?  I thought only magic and Kryptonite could affect him.\n",
      "Yes the vampire bit him, but because Superman is powered by the sun Dracula immediately exploded LOL\n",
      "It takes some imagination to have that happen.  I read that he was originally designed to be a villain.\n",
      "That is very shocking. Do you read any other comic books? I read a lot that were created by Stan Lee, it's too bad that hes passed away\n",
      "I read a lot of Marvel and DC when I was a kid.  I have not kept up.  I liked the Batman book character rather than the brooding one in the movies.  They have been around since 1933.\n",
      "Yes that is definitely a long time. I'm pretty although and even I know that DC stands for Detective Comics, even though that is redundant LOL\n",
      "Yes.  A lot of acronyms create that redundancy problem.  I don't know if I would brag about having the world's biggest comic book library if I was a university.\n",
      "No I'm shocked that they allow people to read those Comics because I know a lot of them are worth money too, I want to read the Marvel published \"generic comic book\" though it sounds really boring but it's probably funny\n",
      "That generic book makes me curious.  I am going to look it up later.  It allowed them to trademark some words.\n",
      "Yes that was very smart of them. Do you know if they trademarked the word Excelsior? apparently Stan lee would always end his phone calls with that word, it definitely his trademark\n",
      "I don't know.  I doubt it though.  Nice Chatting!\n",

      "Good morning, do you like poetry?\n",
      "I think I would be lying if I said yes, I have a passing interest in poetry at best.\n",
      "Haha same here. Did you know there is a poem that when read normally it's depressing, but read backwards, it's inspiring?\n",
      "That must take a lot of effort to create.  Like those pictures that look like one with from one angle and something else from a different one.\n",
      "I agree. The Japanese alphabet, when recited in order forms a poem.\n",
      "Intentionally?  I can name the odd poem but it was never really taught to us in school and I find it hard to appreciate.\n",
      "Not sure if that was intentional. I saw almost all of the Hobbit character names are taken from old Icelandic poems.\n",
      "I would struggle with English poems, Icelandic are definitely not for me.  I understand poetry used to be in the Olympics.\n",
      "Me too.I once saw a guy named Demetri Martin wrote a 224 word palindrome.\n",
      "You watched him write it?  I'm guess NBC would not want to broadcast a poetry writing contest if it were still in the Olympics, not much drama, so to speak.\n",
      "I did not. Do you like birds?\n",
      "Again I have a passing fancy, we put up bird feeder outside the back window, that is about it.\n",
      "There's an extinct Dodo bird that is actually in the same family as the pigeon.\n",
      "The fate of the Dodo always makes my wife cry.  They appear to have been so trusting, which is what to their demise.\n",
      "Yep, very very trusting birds. Some birds fly all the way from Alaska to Northern Mexico without sleeping.\n",
      "I'm the same when I fly, on planes that is, I just can't get comfortable.  I understand some birds, like Ravens, a very smart.\n",
      "Same here. Most birds have hollow bones so they weigh less to fly.\n",
      "One bird that always makes me laugh is the Australian Lyre bird, you should look it up on Youtube if you have never seen it.\n",
      "Haha yea I heard it can mimic sounds of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws. LOL\n",
      "If you get a second watch the video, it is remarkable how accurate it is.  I'd never heard of it but an Australian friend of mine was fully aware.\n",
      "I will take a look at it. It was good talking to you. Take care!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey would you ever go to a poetry stage? I don't really like poetry myself so my answer would be no\n",
      "No I'm pretty bad at poetry, I suck at writing patterns of rhyme\n",
      "Well don't despair, poetry has been around since about 25 BCE, and even the name is taken from ancient Greek and means \"making\"\n",
      "Yea I remember reading some Greek poetry in school like the Odyssey, the Greeks really liked their poetry \n",
      "Yeah they did. It's interesting to that one poet wrote a poem that when read forwards is depressing but when read backwards it is very inspiring\n",
      "Yea that's pretty amazing, it takes a lot of talent to make a depressing poem inspiring when read backwards\n",
      "Haha yes I agree. Do you know what a palindrome is by the way? Apparently Demetri Martin wrote a palindrome poem that is 224 words in length\n",
      "I think it's something to do with words being the same after a certain pattern but w/e it is I couldn't write a 224 word Palindrome\n",
      "On a different topic what do you think about Birds by the way? I did eat a chicken for dinner and it was delicious\n",
      "Birds are pretty awesome, they are technically dinosaurs so I find it fascinating to see living dinosaurs\n",
      "Yes I agree, it's very crazy that they can range in size from 2 inches to over 9 feet\n",
      "Yea, it's crazy birds were the only dinosaurs to survive the extinction event 66 million years ago but they are hardy species\n",
      "What do you think about the dodo bird? I'm kind of sad that it is extinct but at least it is related to pigeons\n",
      "I would love to of seen a real dodo, they look much cooler than pigeons\n",
      "Yep I agree. It's crazy to me that bird bones are actually Hollow and weigh less than their feathers\n",
      "Yea that is pretty amazing, so are the birds who migrate straight to mexico from Alaska without sleeping\n",
      "Yes I wish I could stay awake that long LOL, what do you think about hummingbirds that steal spider webs? They use them to make nests\n",
      "Pretty cool, I guess the webs must help keep things together in the Hummingbirds nest\n",
      "Another topic, do you think we will ever go to Mars? Apparently you would have a higher sounding voice on mars because of the difference in atmosphere\n",
      "Probably not for a while due to all the iron oxide and other hazards on Mars\n",
      "It's weird that there is bacteria that could actually survive on Mars, I don't think there is life on there unfortunately though\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I love the first iron man movie!\n",
      "I don't remember it well. Tony Stark is an industrialist/engineer who comes up with a suit for combat?\n",
      "Robert downey jr does a great job at playing tony stark\n",
      "He gets paid so much! Such a life change for a guy that went to prison for drug problems. The other cast members in the movie are great, too.\n",
      "I love almost all the Marvel movies!\n",
      "I haven't seen the recent ones. I'm not big on superhero films, though I did like the Deadpool films. It was a shame that Stan Lee died.\n",
      "Yeah, stan lee was awesome!  He's an animal!\n",
      "He always ended his phone conversations with the word Excelsior! Not sure why though. I guess it sounds cool. Do you follow GoT?\n",
      "No i have never watched it\n",
      "Game of Thrones is an HBO series based on a novel by G. R. R. Martin. This year is the final season. Huge following!\n",
      "That's cool it's filmed in Ireland.  ALways wanted to go there\n",
      "It costs like a million an episode. One of Charlie Chaplin's descendents is in the series. Would you name your daughter Arya?\n",
      "i like the name... but woulld not name my daughter a trendy name\n",
      "I would name my daughter Hodor, in honor of the giant who says only his name. \n",
      "LOL... ummmmm ok! There's also a descendant of charles dickens\n",
      "Yes, I wonder how many descendants Dickens has. Might quite a large number. Half of London, maybe. \n",
      "It's crazy howmany countries they've filmed in\n",
      "I think it's part of the charm of the series. The writers must have a lot of fun choosing interesting backdrops.  \n",
      "yeah of course, and good for the actors that get to go to all those countries!\n",
      "Tourism goes up in the countries where the filming is done. I would think that governments would do what they could to attract GoT episodes.\n",
      "True! Funny how theres a show about lions using the GoT charecters\n",
      "I think National Geographic is trying to milk the trend. I doubt people watch it for that, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you happen to see the first Iron Man movie?\n",
      "Hi! I did and thoroughly enjoyed it! What about you? I didn't know until after seeing it they the executive producer was Ralphie from A Christmas Story!\n",
      "Hi! I did and thoroughly enjoyed it! What about you? I didn't know until after seeing it that the executive producer was Ralphie from A Christmas Story!\n",
      "Was it really? It's amazing it turned out as good as it did, then. I bet it was chaotic! I think it's also crazy the guy who voiced Jarvis still hasn't seen any of the Iron Man films. It's like why? Ha!\n",
      "Yes it's why it's so energetic. I would have been terrified. I didn't know that either. I often wonder why some actors don't watch their films. \n",
      "It must be an insecurity or something. I'd still want to watch and support myself! Even if I only got half a million for the first movie like Robert Downey Jr. did  (even though he made $10 million for the sequel).\n",
      "I would be too curious about how it turned out. Apparently it was totally worth it for Downey to do the first then since he got such a crazy pay boost for the second. I also feel that he revitalized his career. \n",
      "Agreed. And he did so with a movie that is based on a character Stan Lee created only because he figured no one would like him. Now he's probably the most famous comic book character today! Ha!\n",
      "I agree. Do you also enjoy Game of Thrones? I love that show. \n",
      "I do, actually! So much so, if I ever have a daughter, I wouldn't mind naming it Arya. Ha! It's also the fastest rising name for girls in America!\n",
      "I'm not surprised. I talked a friend out of doing that because I knew it would happen. Do you remember the character Viserys Targaryen?\n",
      "Yes I do! Isn't he also a descendent of Charles Dickens? Guess that explains how he got famous, right? Ha!\n",
      "He is he is the great-great-great grandson of Dickens. On the same note do you know who the actress that played Robb Stark's wife Talisa is related to?\n",
      "I heard it was Charlie Chaplin. Did they require you to be a relative of a legend during the casting process or something? Ha! I suppose it makes it so much easier to be picked knowing you have Chaplin or Dickens' blood in you!\n",
      "Ha ha I guess so because yes she is the granddaughter of Chaplin. \n",
      "Got you! So have you ever watched the Nat Geo show Game of Lions? It basically showcases the lives of different lions as if they're actual Game of Thrones characters. It's very interesting and entertaining. \n",
      "Ha ha, no. I had no idea that existed. It does sound interesting. Did you know that Game of  Thrones is largely filmed in Ireland?\n",
      "I did and also heard the tourism there finances it. That is crazy! I mentioned lions earlier and speaking of lions, they say animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they're domesticated. I wonder if that applies to lions as well?\n",
      "Good question. I wonder if it's just that one animal that has to be domesticated or the whole species?\n",
      "It's definitely worth looking into, I suppose! But being there are roughly 20 quintillion animals on the planet, that would be a lot of white patches. Ha!\n",
      "Wow! That's a larger number than I can wrap my head around.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, do you like the superhero movies?\n",
      "Some of them, Yes I do!\n",
      "Have you seen Iron-Man?\n",
      "I have seen the first one I think. Is that the one where he has that thing in his chest and flies around? haha\n",
      "Yes, that is the first one. DO you know who produces it?\n",
      "From what I recall, that was a really good movie! I'll re-watch it, because I remember that I enjoyed it a lot! That film grossed $585 million on a $140 million budget to prove it!\n",
      "Yeah Marvel for sure made a lot of money off that movie. Do you have an interest in animals?\n",
      "Yes I do! Quite a lot of interest actually! What about you?\n",
      "Yes me too. DO you know how many animals are in the world, individuals?\n",
      "I didn't but had to find out! It's 20 quintillion animals on this earth! That's crazy! The number broke my brain! lol\n",
      "I do not even know how many zeroes are in that number , to be honest\n",
      "same! I'm horrific at math! lol So, I just found out that in 2002 Germany became the first country in the world to give non-human animals constitutionally guaranteed legal rights! Wow, we should do the same! That's good to hear that any country did that! We have a lot of animal abuse and neglect issues that  might be addressed if we did so.\n",
      "That is very true and it is sad so maybe we can remain hopeful since there are governments in other countries who are doing something about it\n",
      "Ernst Haeckel who divided the animal kingdom into 2 classes, animalia and protozoa, also happened to make some of my most favorite artworks ever! You should check out the animal diagrams that he created! They are so good!\n",
      "Wow, I will do that. Do you have a pet?\n",
      "I sure do! :) Do you? I have cats, dogs and fish! But I've had a huge amount of \"animal friends\" throughout my life! Also I'd love to get chickens if I had the space, so that I could raise them for eggs. I aspire to be a kind of farmer. That is to live with a bunch of plants and animals. lol\n",
      "Yeah, I have a dog and I heard  that they develop white patches on the forehead if they are domesticated but I have not seen it in my dog\n",
      "Interesting! Yeah I have a black dog and I guess I'm going to be checking her head for white patches later on to test that theory! :)\n",
      "Yeah. Do you know why we still have hiccups?\n",
      "No. Why?\n",
      "An overlap of the time when we had both gills and lungs\n",
      "Oh wow! That's so cool! I'm really into science stuff, I'm going to look into that! Hard to believe that life has been around on earth for over 650 million years! Such an amazing thing to think about! It's been a real pleasure chatting with you! Say hello, to your dog for me! :)\n",
      "Same here, thanks for a great chat :)\n",

      "Hey. You watch the Olympics? How cool are the skeleton helmets!\n",
      "Hey, I watched some of the Olympics. Those skeleton helmets are very cool\n",
      "Yeah kind of like a mix between Game of Thrones and Dracula!\n",
      "For sure. Do you like the movie Iron Man?\n",
      "Yes I love that movie.Tony Stark plays Iron Man so well!\n",
      "He is a very good actor. Did you know Downey Jr. only made 500 thousand for Iron Man, but made 10 million for Iron Man 2?\n",
      "Wow what a huge contrast, well deserving though he is the man behind the success! Stan Lee created Iron Man because he thought no one would like him!\n",
      "Stan Lee is awesome. Stinks that he passed away recently. He lived a long good life.\n",
      "Yeah he was a mastermind behind all the comics. Did you know the first ironman movie was filmed without a script?\n",
      "Oh wow that's amazing. Tony Stark's captors are revealing the entire movie plot in a language called urdu in the beginning of Iron Man.\n",
      "So cool. I also really like animals. There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on earth!\n",
      "That's a ton of animals! There is a lawyer in Switzerland who represents animals in court.\n",
      "Power to the animals! Germany also protects them as they were the first country to universally give animals constitutional rights!\n",
      "That's hilarious! There's a jellyfish that can live forever.\n",
      "Wow. blessing and a curse I suppose. I hate getting the hiccups but apparently its from early evolution of having both gills and lungs.\n",
      "I agree. That's funny, I didn't know that about hiccups. \n",
      "Yeah. There are also cool animals on TV like in Game of Thrones or in other words A Song of Fire and Ice.\n",
      "Animals have a dominant paw like humans.\n",
      "Oh I wonder if most are right paw dominant like us? There is actually a show on nat geo about Lions and they are portrayed as Game of Thrones characters!\n",
      "I wonder as well. That would be cool to see that show. What a good idea.\n",
      "Yes. GOT is actually financed by Ireland to increase tourism!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Have you seen the Black Panther? I wanted to see it but never got around to it.\n",
      "Nope. I haven't.. I heard it was great. I think it came out in 2018.\n",
      "It turns out the Black Panther is the richest superhero.\n",
      "Dang, I figured Bruce Wayne would have taken that spot. Marvel Comics made a good profit too..\n",
      "Black Panther is at $500 billion apparently, and Bruce Wayne $80 billion. Not sure exactly how that is calculated.\n",
      "I heard Michael B Jordan did a great job acting as the Black Panther.\n",
      "And Chadwick Boseman couldn't afford to go to a prestigious summer theater program. He got funding through a private benefactor who actually was denzel washington.\n",
      "Denzel is awesome.. I was sad that Stan Lee a creator of the comics had died last year. Whose your favorite character?\n",
      "I actually am not really into superheroes. I guess I would say Superman, because I used to like to watch the Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman when I was a kid. How about you?\n",
      "I actually like Blue Ear because of the story behind the character.\n",
      "Hmm, I haven't heard of that one. I find it interesting that Marvel offered all their characters to Sony for $25 million and that offer was rejected in 1998.\n",
      "They probably lost a lot of revenue. Blue Ear was created because a 4 year old was uncomfortable wearing hearing aides.\n",
      "That's an interesting story. Yes, I am sure they lost a lot of money since all sorts of superheroes are extremely popular these days.\n",
      "I guess you could look up the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes to find the good superhero movies.\n",
      "Yes, Rotten Tomatoes is a good resource. I just learned it is owned by Warner Bros.\n",
      "They seem to own everything. Michael Bays movies have an average rating of 38%. \n",
      "I can't believe that Spykids got a 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. I didnt' feel it was that good.\n",
      "I don't like Spy Kids at all. I thought it was too hokey.\n",
      "Yeah, it definitely wasn't fun for me. It has a better rating than The Dark Knight Rises, for instance, which is surprising.\n",
      "Netflix has 150 movies available with a 100% rating. It seems Netflix is the way to go.\n",
      "I do subscribe to Netflix but I find I run out of stuff to watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you? I like movies! Do you??\n",
      "Hi! I do love movies as well! In fact, I loved Black Panther and do agree with the fresh eating on Rotten tomatoes as well as the 100% rating it got on the first 50 reviews!\n",
      "I ain't seed the Black Panther film yet, but I knowd that it got nomanated for a prize or something.\n",
      "David Ehrlich from Indie Wire said it's the first superhero movie that \"flows with a genuine sense of cultural identity, memory and musicality\" and he couldn't be more accurate! \n",
      "I guess I shold ought to see it then. It sounds real good. Is it based on a comic or something?\n",
      "It is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. But Black Panther himself actually made his debut in Captain America: Civil War in 2014!\n",
      "I dint see that one either. There are alot of superheros out there and a bunch of films with them. Marvel? Is that the batman, and the superman?\n",
      "I honestly don't know. But I do know, surprisingly enough, That Black Panther is actually the richest superhero with an estimated networth of $500 billion. That's more than Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark combined! That is crazy, isn't it?\n",
      "I guess any thing is possable in the superhero unaverse. I could be rich if i were a superhero.\n",
      "So true! Speaking of money, Marvel actually offered 5he cinematic rights of nearly all of its characters to Sony for $25 million but they would only purchase Spider-Man's rights for $10 million thinking movie goers would only like him. Boy, was that a mistake on Sony's part!\n",
      "Boy, they WERE dumb. $25 million? That aint hardly nothin for Sony.\n",
      "Agreed! I think it's also crazy that Disney doesn't own the rights to the characters like Spider-Man,X-Men, Avengers, etc. in theme parks on the east side of the Mississippi river because of a contract they signed with Universal Studios back in the 1990s!\n",
      "That is a odd legal scramble over those characters. I think that it would be better to buy them all and not have the confusion.\n",
      "Agreed. Speaking of legal scrambles, Marvel was successful in their court arguments that mutants weren't people and thus, were able to pay lower rates on X-Men toys instead of higher rates for the dolls simply because they're not technically human. I thought that was funny!\n",
      "I agree. Totally. Funny! It's a good idea to be human in the US, but not if you're a doll. I see now how I should proceed if I get a species change in the future.\n",
      "Ha! No kidding! Since we're on the subject of comic book characters and movies, are you familiar with Rotten Tomatoes? I never knew until recently that they were owned by Warner Bros.\n",
      "I use Rotten Tomatoes for many things. They got rid of the best parts of it though. Now its just got regular movies on there. Still, its good enough.\n",
      "Agreed. I think it's sad that Michael Bay's average movie rating on Rotten Tomatoes is an abysmal 38%. That's bad for such a big name director. \n",
      "He is good with the special effects and such like. He knows how to blow up things. Boom! 38%\n",
      "Ha! So true! And then, no video game based movie has received a rating over 44% on the site either. That's sad as well.\n",
      "That sounds wrong. Those movies have a loyal fan base. I figure something must be good in there.\n",
      "So true! And I thought it was surprising Spy Kids received a higher rating than both The Dark Knight Rises and Lincoln. Spy Kids got a 93%. Now that is unbelievable to me. Ha! Well, it was nice chatting with you today. Take care, friend!\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Hello,  have you ever seen Black Panther?\n",
      "No I haven't, but from everything I've seen I think I should. Have you?\n",
      "Yeah,  its a great movie!  Kinda slow at first then it picks up. Did you know Black Panther is the wealthiest super hero?\n",
      "No, I didn't. But I'm really curious to know more about the technology and economics of Wakanda.\n",
      "Yeah its really advanced,  they even have a sort of healing bed,  that would be super amazing if we had that. \n",
      "I'm really interested in post-scarcity themes in science fiction, so I need to watch it for sure.\n",
      "Its on Netflix right now,  you should before they take it off lol \n",
      "Absolutely. It's the next on my list.\n",
      "Have you watched any of the other Marvel movies?\n",
      "I'm not normally much of a comics or superhero person. Have you?\n",
      "Yeah I think I have watched all of them lol Did you know there is one character that both marvel and dc own?\n",
      "I didn't. But I wish there was less intellectual property over characters and it was easier to mix them up in fanfic.\n",
      "Yeah.  I guess.  I hear marvel created a super hero called blue ear for a 4 year old boy who didnt want to wear hearing aids.\n",
      "That's cool. I like the idea of regular people seeing themselves more in comics.\n",
      "yeah.  Do  you know Michael Bay?  His average rotten tomatoes film rating is 38%?\n",
      "No, I've never heard of him to be honest.\n",
      "He is the director of most of the Transformer movies. \n",
      "I don't think I've seen any of those.\n",
      "ok cool. \n",
      "Have you watched any of them?\n",
      "Yeah almost all of them. \n",
      "Cool! Nice chatting with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you watched Infinity War?\n",
      "I have not seen Avenger's Infinity war yet have you?\n",
      "I haven't either. Some fans were mad that Hawkeye was forgotten in the trailer. I'm not really sure who Hawkeye is, honestly. \n",
      "I am not sure either lol, but he is a part of the films since 2011's Thor. I guess I would wonder too!\n",
      "Fans even started a petition on Change.org saying that he should appear in future Infinity War promotional materials. Haha.\n",
      "Really? That's awesome haha! I guess they are saying they didn't put Hawkeye in the trailer because he has a special spot in this film, so it makes people speculate what he will be doing in the Infinity War film.\n",
      "Fans also felt though that in previous movies Hawkeye has not been given justice.\n",
      "True, I heard that too. I can't say because I havent seen the movie. But I do enjoy the Marvel Comic films. \n",
      "Yeah, I like the Marvel Comics series that they have on Netflix.\n",
      "Yes! And I found it interesting that the marvel films are distributed by Walt Disney Pictures, but it makes sense!\n",
      "Interesting! They do not have the rights to show big Marvel characters in theme parks in certain areas though.\n",
      "That's interesting! The movie industry is confusing lol....I love Walt Disney pictures though and I guess it makes sense they share the Marvel Comic movies, I suppose there are contracts.\n",
      "It's funny also that there is one character owned by both Marvel and DC named Access whose only purpose is to keep both companies' universes  separate\n",
      "How strange lol! About as strange as Michael Jackson trying to buy Marvel comics so he could play spider man!\n",
      "Hah, I had never heard that. Speaking of selling rights, Marvel offered cinematic rights for nearly all characters to Sony for 25 million in 1998. They rejected the offer and only purchased Spiderman's rights for $10 million thinking that nobody really cared about the other characters.\n",
      "Oh no! Hahaha! that was a huge mistake by Sony, whoa, I would be sick lol.\n",
      "I know right? My kids love them. They have some of the dolls. Marvel argued in court that they were mutants and not people in order to pay lower rates on toys.\n",
      "Really? Haha, not sure if that worked! Marvel comic toys are expensive. \n",
      "Not sure but it just increases the profit margin for the company haha.\n",
      "True! I am going to have to watch this Infinity War movie now lol, curious about this Hawkeye character. Although he has been in other Marvel films.\n",
      "Yeah, I heard it was good. I will have to check it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you watch Infinity Wars?\n",
      "No.  I heard that it was the first film ever shot in digital imax.\n",
      "Interesting. I have not watched it either. I wonder why it caused an increase in shawarma sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't even know what a shawarma is.  I suspect it was shown in an attractive way in the film.\n",
      "I believe some kind of sandwich in pita bread. It's amazing that the voice actor who played jarvis in the iron man series and avengers hasn't actually seen the films\n",
      "It sure is!  Marvel has sure made a mint out of their group of characters.\n",
      "Do you like to read marvel comics?\n",
      "Yes.  At least I have. I originally started with DC comics but the Marvel characters seemed more nuanced.  They really got some big league actors in that Infinity film including Robert Downey Jr. and Josh Brolin.\n",
      "Have you heard of Blue Ear? This superhero was created for a four year old boy who was uncomfortable wearing hearing aids. The boy told his mom that superheroes don't wear hearing aids so Marvel created one.\n",
      "That is neat!  How about \"The Lion King\" being dubbed into Zulu for its African release?  That is also neat.\n",
      "That is cool. I like that Frozen was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman. It sure was successful.\n",
      "They used to have to draw animation frames by hand, so they also reused some in movies in the 70s.\n",
      "Yeah, I can imagine. Drawing by hand requires a lot of effort.\n",
      "Yes.  That undoubtedly made each frame costly.  Disney is one of the Big Six film makers, and of course they do things that are not animated.\n",
      "Yes, they own Marvel right?\n",
      "No.  Marvel hocked all of their hero rights to borrow money to build their own production company.  It became successful or Merril Lynch would have owned the rights.\n",
      "Hmm, interesting. Did you know there is one character owned by both Marvel and DC named Access? His purpose is to keep both companies' universes separate. I have to look into that.\n",
      "I have not heard of the character.  The name does not make the superpower obvious either.  Marvel did not start using the name Marvel until 1961.  They were Atlas Comics before that.\n",
      "So Sony rejected a deal to purchase all of the rights to Marvel characters for $25 million. THey only bought Spiderman for $10 million thinking that audiences would only care about him.\n",
      "There have been a lot of such offers that were not accepted then looked like bargains in hindsight.  I guess you were right about Disney acquiring Marvel Entertainment.  Sorry for the misinformation.\n",
      "That's okay. Yes, I guess they acquired Marvel in 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Good Morning....don''t know anything about Avengers or Infinity War....but I'll try my best on it. Your views?\n",
      "Good morning, I saw the movie, and thought it was pretty good.  It contains alot of different superheroes that have to work together and try to stop the bad gut Thanos from getting all the Infinity stones.  Having all of then allows him to instantly kill off billions of people on Earth.  Spoiler Alert: He gets the stones and some of the people killed are even some of the most beloved superheroes.\n",
      "Wow! Wait a sec....I did see one of those Avengers movies. (Can't remember which one). But, I liked the Robert Downey Jr. character (can't remember his name) But, Simple Minds \"Don't You (Forget About Me)\" is a pretty awful song.\n",
      "I agree with you about the song! All I think is a Molly Ringwald 80s movie.  Well, anyway what's so funny about Robert Downey Jr. is that he hid food while he was on the set and the crew could never find the food he hid, so they just kept letting him do it.  Some of the scenes in the movie are  some of the food he hid.\n",
      "LOL...Was Robert Downey's character called \"Flash\" or something? I can't remember, been years since I saw it. Too many of these movies have flooded the market with so many characters, I can't keep up. I'd never download a Jeremy Renner app though. Dont need all the ads that probably come with it.\n",
      "Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark AKA Ironman.  And I have too many apps already, I couldn't download another, if I wanted to!\n",
      "LOL...thanks for the info. Man, I don't even remember that character name, but I loved the first movie with him. Perhaps I should seek out more of those movies, good escape entertainment. \n",
      "The little kid that lives next door to me loves the flash, though.  I see him in his costume zooming around in their yard all the time.  Too funny! Have you ever watched Disney's Big Hero 6?\n",
      "Nah....haven't seen it. I'm 61 years old and those movies like the new Avengers: Infinity War rely on your knowledge on the characters to truly follow along with the plots. Heck, I can't believe this is already the 19th film from Marvel Comics.\n",
      "Hey, you're never too old.  I'm a grandparent myself! Lol I did see Big Hero 6 with my grandsons and it's a good little cartoon movie.  Fantastic graphics it was made using a 55,000 core supercomputer.  \n",
      "That;s probably the reason why I don't get caught up in those movies. I don't have any children, let alone grandchildren, I bet they keep you up on what's going on with these Marvel Comics films. I wasn't even much of a comic book reader when I was a young man.\n",
      "Yes, they do that!  Do you remember watching Disney's, \"The Jungle Book\"?\n",
      "Now, you're talking more my speed...LOL. Yes, I liked the Jungle Book as well as more of the Walt Disney pictures.\n",
      "Well, I only found out recently that the four vultures towards the end of the movie that sing were based on the Beatles.  Isn't that funny?\n",
      "Wow! The Beatles are my all-time favorite band. It's been years since I saw the Jungle Book, but sort of remember that end of the movie. I'm gonna have to watch that Walt Disney picture again...put a smile on my face.\n",
      "Yes, it is a classic for sure and I too love the Beatles.  Have you ever seen the Pixar move,\"UP\"?\n",
      "I've never even heard of it. What's it about?\n",
      "It's a Children's cartoon movie, it's kind of sad, to me.  It's about a little old man that ties balloons to his house to float it to his and his dead wife's favorite place.  I always wondered how many balloons it would take to lift a house, if that's even possible.  You hear of people strapping theirselves in lawnchairs with balloons tied to it, but a house, I bet that would take many balloons to lift that?\n",
      "LOL....I hear ya, I haven't given that much thought. But, just what you said reminded me why I loved the Walk Disney pictures as compared with the Marvel films. The Disney Pictures always pulled at your heart strings and were more sentimental than the BOOM-CRASH action films. That's perhaps why I loved them.\n",
      "That is so true, Disney is a master at that!  \n",
      "You're great to chat with, glad you controlled this one. Knew very little about Marvel Comics or the newer films. Have a Great day, and hope to run across you again in these chats.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi. Do you like movies?\n",
      "Hello there, I do, I love movies.  How about yourself?\n",
      "I do. I am a big Disney fan. I even like the movies in the 70s despite them recycling a lot of animated frames.\n",
      "Yeah I love movies from the 70's and especially the 80's.  Disney made a ton of good movies in the 80's and 90's. \n",
      "Thats about the time that they started working on Wreck-it-Ralph. That's a really long time.\n",
      "Wow, that is a long time to make a movie.  I don't think most people realize how long some of those animated movies take to make. \n",
      "I would think a year. Do you like the marvel movies?\n",
      "I think they are ok, but I have not seen too many of them.  How about you?\n",
      "I have seen a lot of them. I liked the Avengers. Do you know any characters or actors from that movie franchise?\n",
      "Not really no, but I do know the characters from the X-men series, I grew up watching those cartoons. \n",
      "I just learned that marvel paid less for x-men toys because they are not human, they are mutants. How interesting.\n",
      "Wow, I'm sure there was a court battle and a lot of money spent over that issue. \n",
      "Did you know Disney owns marvel?\n",
      "I did not know that, but that is a smart move.  They can release as many superhero movies as they want then. \n",
      "What is really interesting is that they do not own them east of the Mississippi due to a contract with universal studios\n",
      "Really? That is very interesting.  Did you know they created a superhero who was deaf and needed hearing aids?\n",
      "I did not know that. I also did not know that there is one character that is owned by DC and marvel whose sole purpose is to keep the companies universes separate. I wonder what character it is. DO you know?\n",
      "Really, no I don't know.  But I wonder why they would do that and what Marvel thought when DC started that character. \n",
      "They are both worth so much money. There must be a legal reason for it. Sony could have purchased them all for 25 million 20 years ago but decided not to.\n",
      "Yeah think about that decision not being made, and like blockbuster buying netflix, crazy how some things pay off and some things don't. \n",
      "It was nice chatting with you, I learned a lot of new things.\n",
      "Yeah same here, I hope you have a good day. \n",
      "\n",

      "Hello. Do you use Google much? A single Google search is so powerful!\n",
      "I love Google, it is the #1 search engine, how about you\n",
      "Yes I love it too. I mention that it was a powerful search engine. A single search requires more computing power than it took to send Neil Armstrong to the moon.\n",
      "That is so crazy to think how far technology has come. I click enter in Google and I have more power than that!\n",
      "It really has come along way. Google maps even tracks traffic by tracking how fast android devices are moving.\n",
      "wow lol, that is awesome. Did you hear about their headquarters?\n",
      "Are you referring to the fact that they haven't goats mow their lawn instead of people LOL?\n",
      "right, you think they would help the economy more and hire a lawn crew or something lol\n",
      "Yes good point. They have so much traffic on their site. In 2013 Google went down for about five minutes and took 40% of web traffic with it.\n",
      "wow, I bet that is true! What do you think of their self driving cars?\n",
      "I think they are fascinating and likely the future. Nevada thinks so too because they're the first state to allow self driving cars.\n",
      "wow, I think it is scary allow AI to drive for me, but I think it will be the future of cars in my opinion\n",
      "YesIt will free up a lot of time I hope. Mercedes-Benz creative self driving car in the 80s. I thought it was more of a recent thing.\n",
      "Wow, I never knew that. I am one of the 75% of people who are scared of self driving cars, are you?\n",
      "That is a lot of people. I think I am in the minority and I am not scared by them. I am more excited by them.\n",
      "that is awesome, I think that number will change more and more they become popular. It will be like cell phones probably, you need to have one eventually\n",
      "Yeah I am definitely looking forward to getting ones in the future. It would almost be like living in a video game. Speaking of video games they used to be called cathode ray tube amusement devices.\n",
      "Video games sounds much better, lol! I love video games!\n",
      "No doubt about that I do too. A lot of people do actually, as a planet we play 3 billion hours of video games a week. Well I really enjoyed this chat.\n",
      "I enjoyed this chat as well, time to go play cathode ray tube amusement devices! Enjoy your day!\n",
      "Haha awesome! Bye!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "do you use google a lot\n",
      "Yes a lot. Do you know how much a single search takes in terms of power?\n",
      "Yes more than in took to take Armstrong and 11 others to the moon\n",
      "Yes. Do you know how they calculate traffic?\n",
      "Yes they take the average of devices as they more around\n",
      "Yes. Do you know how they mow the lawn?\n",
      "Once they hired goats to eat the grass, pretty cool\n",
      "Yeah I know. Did you hear of that time GOogle went down for 5 minutes?\n",
      "Yes and took down 40% of the web with it\n",
      "Yeah that just speaks volumes on how powerful and used it is\n",
      "Yeah. what do you think of self-driving cars?\n",
      "They are cool. Nevada is the frist state to allow them\n",
      "Yeah. Do you know which game they are using to advance them?\n",
      "Yes they are using Grand Theft Auto 5\n",
      "Yeah. Do you know who was the first person to have an unlocked iPhone?\n",
      "That was George Hotz who built a self driving car in his garage\n",
      "Yeah. Mercedes created self driving cars in the 80s\n",
      "Yes and they went 1200 miles at 109 mph successfully\n",
      "Yeah that project was called the prometheus project\n",
      "Yeah. Did you know that many people are afraid of self driving cars?\n",
      "Yes more than 3/4 of people. Nice chatting with you\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Is google your primary search engine?\n",
      "It is, I just love using Google searches are accurate and fast, I also like Yahoo searches, whay about you? do you like use Google much?\n",
      "I like how google specializes in internet related services and products. They have so much computer power behind a single search that they use more computing power than it took to send man to the moon\n",
      "Wow I guess that is a lot of power, I use the Google Maps a lot so thats another thing that I got to thank google about\n",
      "I like how google in general goes the extra mile. For instance, for countries that dispute borders, google tailors the map according to each country's claims\n",
      "That seems like a lot of work, I wonder how their servers handle that amount of info and have you heard about the self-driving cars Google has?\n",
      "I find self driving cars capable of sensing its environment and responding independently of human intervention is a very interesting concept and it has come a long way. While it may be helpful for things like parking where most factors are static, I find that it will find it hard to compensate for erratic human behavior on the road.\n",
      "You know that about 75% of Americans are scared of them I think I belong to that group, I know they can be helpful in many ways but stil, what if my car gets hacked? what if the robot gets confused?\n",
      "I think if every single car on the road was self driven and hooked into a central system that would be safer than the current emerging situation\n",
      "Could be, I just hope the tech is completely solid before we risk all those self driving cars getting to the streets, do you know who George Holtz is?\n",
      "I only say this because human error is a bigger threat to program that have strict guidelines. Then again as you say there may be a bug that leads to cascades of failures the lead to disaster. Who is George Holtz\n",
      "Yeah I see your point, human error is a big threat indeed and George Holt is the first person to ever unlock and Iphone, well he built a self driving car in his garage isnt that amazing? I bet that was the product of years of hard work\n",
      "It is. The potential benefits of this technology ranges from increased mobility to increased safety to say the least.\n",
      "You know the game Grand Theft Auto 5 is actually being used to improve the ai of self driving cars\n",
      "Really? Are video games being used to test AI?\n",
      "Yeah apparently they are, you know video games were used to have a super long and weird name\n",
      "Ah you mean when they were called cathode ray amusement devices by the military? Ya that is a mouthful\n",
      "Yeah Cathode Ray Amusements Devices, its a long and boring name for sure lol, I wonder why its ilegar to play video games past midnight if your 16 in South Korea\n",
      "It probably because too many kids can be addicted to games so to encourage kids to use computers and game less, they have such a rule\n",
      "I think its a great rule, the same rule should be applied in america lol, its crazy how many hours of video games are played in a week, if you add all the hours the numbers are just too big\n",
      "I do find that it a practical solution. However, given that many south korean kids are studying till late, time constraints may be a thing. In any case, this chat was a pleasure. I hope you have a wonderful evening.\n",
      "\n",

      "Transportation seems to be the focus theses days. Autonomous cars are taking over. Nevada was the 1st state to get onboard and allow self-driving cars.\n",
      "Would You trust a self driving car ?\n",
      "Hmmm. thats a good question. I know the benefits are huge...increased traffic flow, better mobility for those who don't drive like children and elderly...they're making strides everyday.\n",
      "It scares the heck out of me... machines can't be trusted with our lives like that... plus the joy of driving is something I'm not willing to give up...\n",
      "& 5% of Americans feel the way you do. Mercedez-Benz built a self-driving car in the 80's. This was called the Prometheus Project.\n",
      "Good for Mercedes, but based what I know about that techology is still flawed... based on white lanes on the road and sensors around the vehicle... what if it snows ? or it's so cold the sensors will go crazy ? no no no... sorry ;) there is no way I'm getting into car like that ;)\n",
      "Actually, self-driving cars IMPROVE safety. Advanced control systems with high tech sensors help to safely operate the car without the factor of human judgement errors. Sounds good to me.\n",
      "Ok - how does a car know to change the lane ? I mean how does the car knows it's IN the lane and when it will be in the right lane after changing lanes ?\n",
      "Technology is amazing. Just like we have technology such as GPS that knows how to guide us, self-driving technology is mind-blowing.\n",
      "GPS is different. The worst that might happen is You get lost... but with self driving technology ? You can die... It's way too dangerous...\n",
      "When I think of all the drivers who get into accidents by making unsafe lane changes, not detecting objects in blind areas and so forth, I feel that robots are much better at detecting these things.\n",
      "That's a valid point - but once a person is making that mistake it's his own - and his own responsibility AND the punishment will be just for that man. Who will take responsibility for a faulty batch of cars ? And another thing, don't You feel like we are giving our freedom little piece by piece ? They want to control us... how fast we drive, they want to know where we are all the time... what if they will take control of Your car against Your will... it's just a scary concept for me...\n",
      "Understandedly!! People have the same thoughts as related to cell phones and Alexa and others. Self driving cars also help to keep others safe...by making sure that you share the road safely with others.\n",
      "I do share the road safely with others... if somebody is not, he/she should be send to re-do their driving license... there is too many factors to trust a machine... last year tesla car killed a woman on a bicycle because the sensors didn't work as they should... I mean the person INSIDE of the car was fine and safe but a biker was killed...  \n",
      "I agree that should not have happened. That's why technology continues to advance to make them safer. MANY people kill others everyday...on bikes....motorcycles...pedestrians.. far more than are killed by self driving cars.\n",
      "Here is my point... this scares me because it starts innocent like this - great, safe technology of the future... sure. BUT what I'm afraid of is that in 50 years, man won't have a choice and WILL HAVE TO use that technology... I want freedom. I love freedom, and I hope we will have both - self driving cars for people who needs it, and regular cars for people that love driving... \n",
      "I think that whether or not to drive a self-driving vehicle will REMAIN a choice. 75% of Americans are uncomfortable as you yourself are. The battle is on, nonetheless, UBER and Waymo are both fighting for the winning spot in transportation.\n",
      "Waymo... I don't think I've heard about that one... is there a difference between those two ? Of course they compete... huge money are involved ;)\n",
      "Waymo is an Alphabet-owned autonomous driving car company. They claim UBER stole some trade-secrets from them. The trial is cutthroat...to them winning is everything...2nd to none!\n",
      "wow, is that like happening now ? Is that current news ?\n",
      "They actually reached a settlement earlier this year. The battle still continues on...lol. It was nice talking to you. Emjoy your day.\n",

      "How's it going, are you into comics? They originated in 18th century Japan\n",
      "Hey! I was in the past! Yeah it seems like they took off in Japan and was a huge industry by 1995!\n",
      "It's pretty cool Stan Lee would end every phone call with \"excelsior\"\n",
      "Haha yeah that is cool. He created so much. Marvel even published a generic comic book to trademark super-hero and super-villain!\n",
      "Pretty smart idea to trademark \"super-hero\" and \"super-villain\", I wonder how marvel get's paid for it\n",
      "Agreed they make a ton of money now. They beat out DC for sure. DC comics stands for detective comics by the way.\n",
      "Lol, Detective Comics comics, it is really redundant \n",
      "Very! The marvel cinematic universe takes place on earth but in a different multiverse.\n",
      "Yea Marvel denoted the cinematic universe as earth-199999 in their canon\n",
      "Interesting. Do you like Marvel films? I loved Black Panther, Ryan Coogler did a good job directing!\n",
      "Yea Black Panther was great, Chadwick Boseman did a great job as T'Challa\n",
      "Agreed. The symbols and written script are based on an actual scripts called nsibdi.\n",
      "That's pretty cool Black Panther incorporated nsibdi scrips in the film\n",
      "Yeah very cool. The characters name was briefly changed to black leopard in order to not associate it with the party name black panther.\n",
      "I never knew Marvel's Black Panther came out before the Black Panther party\n",
      "Yeah I didn't know that either. I also love the movie Deadpool and I saw both the first and second. In 2004 reynold read the comic and though he was destined for the role!\n",
      "Well the Deadpool comic described himself as Ryan Reynold crossed with a shar-pei\n",
      "Yeah that explains it. The voice of the mystery villain in deadpool 2 is actually ryan reynolds!\n",
      "That's pretty cool. Did you know the Deadpool video game cost more to make than the movie?\n",
      "How is that even possible!! Apparently Deadpool 2 is the 11th installment of the X-men film series. \n",
      "Neat. Well I have to go, nice chatting with you\n",

      "Have you heard about the Puerto Rico Strong anthology of comics?\n",
      "never before this is my first time, have you?\n",
      "Yes. All the profits go to United Way of Puerto Rico. It has a lot of stories about Puerto Ricos history.\n",
      "Sounds interesting doesn't it? Specially given the great writers behind the comic. And it's a great cause as well. Have you seen the Black panther films before?\n",
      "Haven't seen it, but heard good things from the critics. I know it came out this year and was made by Marvel.\n",
      "Yes correct, I've seen the first but have yet to see the second. Given their intentions and the great writers do you believe it will have an impact on the public's perception on Puerto Rico and its history?\n",
      "I think it might. Especially after the hurricane that hit there. They had a lot of economic problems before it hit.\n",
      "Yeah, I hope so too. Given that they still seem to be struggling from the Hurricane to this day. It's interesting how they are implementing comics for this. Its interesting how popular they became in the US and UK even though they originated in Japan.   \n",
      "Yeah, it was a great move for them. And the cover artist was Naomi Franquez. She did a good job.\n",
      "Yeah, for sure. Hopefully the general public hears about the history behind the Jones act and the struggle the Island has had economically, specially from their own point of view.  \n",
      "Yes. One of the co-creators had worked on Deadpool. It's good they got such amazing people to do it.\n",
      "Hopefully an impact is made. I cant believe how Deadpool became one of the highest grossing r-rated films of all times, I knew it would be big but not this big. \n",
      "Wow. Caught people by surprise. There was a lot of diversity in the Puerto Rico Strong project, and a lot of diversity in Deadpool 2.\n",
      "yes, didn't know about that before this. I find interesting how Super Hero movies like these can implement actual cultural artifacts like the writings on the script that originally originated from Nigeria. It's just amazing, hopefully this new comic book also has interesting facts like these as well as serves its intended cause.\n",
      "Yes. It's good to learn about cultures. MSU (Mich State U) has the largest available comic collection in the entire world that is available to the public.\n",
      "Yep. how so many offered to answer the call for such a project speaks a lot about the Puerto Rican people like Schwartz mentioned.  \n",
      "Yeah. They really wanted to do it. for Puerto Rico. It was thanks also to Lion Forge. They were the publisher for the comic.\n",
      "Yeah not only the people but these organizations like Lion Forge who will match the first $25,000 and Diamond Comic Distributors also donating 5 percent of retail sales to United Way of Puerto Rico . \n",
      "Yes. Comic books really do mean a lot to people. It's interesting that dc stands for detective comics.\n",
      "Oh yeah, I was thinking the same. Never crossed my mind to even think about what DC stands for. I just hope that all their intentions become reality and the people of Puerto Rico at the end of the day benefit from this. It was nice speaking with you about an interesting topic like this. \n",
      "Yes. Thank you for the conversation on this topic. It was intriguing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey there what do you think about Puerto Rico? You think it should become a state.\n",
      "I'm on the fence. I see good points and bad points. I'm more concerned with the devastation the destruction they've had from Hurricane Maria.\n",
      "Yeah it sounds like it was really bad over there. I guess they started a comic book about Puerto Rico to help raise money \n",
      "Yes, I heard that too. It's called Puerto Rico Strong. I can't remember who the donations go to though, do you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes they go to the United Way of Puerto Rico. I think that's a good cause. And also the donations will be matched by other \n",
      "Yeah, that was it. I'm not a big comic book fan, but this is such a great cause. I like h ow they are involving so many Puerto Rican comic book writers and they write about any topic to bring awareness to Puerto Rico.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah I agree. Definitely a good cause. Would you read comic books outside of the Puerto Rico comic though? I only watch comic book movies myself\n",
      "No, not really my thing, but when I was growing up, my Dad had a collection from his younger years that he would pull out from time to time and we'd read through them. They have changed so much over the years. They've been around in the US since 1933. \n",
      "Yeah that's impressive. that's definitely a long time, it said Stan Lee passed away, I love that he would end his phone conversations with the word\"Excelsior\"\n",
      "That's funny! There are so many fun facts! Like MSU has the largest comic book collection in their library.\n",
      "Yeah I didn't know that. I actually have friends that went there and I never even heard that they had a comic book collection. Do you like Marvel or DC Comics more by the way?\n",
      "I like Marvel. Have you seen Black Panther? It was based on the Marvel comics.\n",
      "See black panther. I was shocked to learn that he is actually the richest superhero, even more wealthy than Tony Stark who is Iron Man\n",
      "Really?! I didn't realize that the character black panther predated the founding of the black panther party.\n",
      "I didn't know that either. I also didn't know that the symbols used in the movie were based on real written symbols from the 4th Century, that is impressive\n",
      "That's pretty cool...I wonder how many movies have been made based on Marvel comics. Do you know of any more?\n",
      "Yes there's Iron Man, Captain America, and they're coming out with Captain Marvel soon. Personally I think there are too many Marvel movies coming out though LOL\n",
      "lol...Yeah, my son likes them, but not me. I think Deadpool was another one. Also, another one I didn't see. lol\n",
      "Oh Deadpool's actually really good! I like knowing that the main character in Black Panther gave thanks to Denzel Washington, because Denzel lent him money back in the beginning of his career\n",
      "I didn't know that! That's pretty cool. There were some really good actors/actresses in Black Panther. I actually may take the time to watch that one. lol\n",
      "Yes it's worth a watch. and you should see Deadpool 1, but maybe not Deadpool 2, I thought Deadpool one was a lot better personally\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you seen Black Panther?\n",
      "No I haven't yet. Is it any good?\n",
      "I thought it was pretty good. The character is the richest superhero with an estimated 500 billion dollars.\n",
      "That's impressive. I always thought the richest was Tony Stark.\n",
      "He is close - 100 billion dollars. With bruce wayne at 80.\n",
      "I guess you need a lot of money to be a superhero these days.  Do you know if they are going to make a sequel to the movie?\n",
      "I don't know, I would think so. It was really popular.\n",
      "Seems like I saw the character, Black Panther, in the movie Captain America-Civil War.  Was he in it?\n",
      "I'm not sure - I haven't seen that one.  Have you seen Deadpool?\n",
      "Sorry,  I haven't seen that one either.  Was it good?\n",
      "It was okay. There are so many superhero movies these days. It's the eleventh movie in the x-men series. \n",
      "I didn't know it was part of the x-men.  I have seen a few of those movies.  \n",
      "Have you seen any good movies lately?\n",
      "I actually haven't. I know Ryan Reynolds is in Deadpool and I like him. I just haven't gotten around to seeing it yet.\n",
      "Yeah - he was good in it. He's funny.\n",
      "He is funny. I liked him in that movie with Sandra Bullock.\n",
      "Oh I don't think I have seen that one.\n",
      "It's good.  I think it's where she's his boss and has him pose as a boyfriend and then end up falling in love.  If I'm right, Betty White is in it too.  You know, Ryan Reynolds actually worked on the script for Deadpool.\n",
      "Yeah he also was one of the directors.\n",
      "He invested a lot in that movie.\n",
      "Yeah he did. Well it was nice talking to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you tonight? Do you know who Chris Pratt is?\n",
      "Hi there I do like Chris Pratt a lot actually. I really like him in the movie Guardians of the Galaxy. What about you?\n",
      "I saw him on that TV show, Parks and Rec. I didn't know that at 19 years old, he was waiting tables at a Bubba Gump Shrimp \n",
      "That is really funny. I also heard that he slept in his while back in the day. I guess James Gunn, who directed Guardians of the Galaxy, wanted Chris Pratt in that movie really bad which is nice, because I think he did a great job\n",
      "I didn't know that the six pack was CGI! That's great! I figure those guys would get trainers, but I guess Chris wouldn't bother.\n",
      "Nope good for him though. Because no one could tell haha. Do you ever watch Always Sunny in Philadelphia? The guy who plays Dennis on there was apparently high in the running to play the lead in Guardians of the Galaxy\n",
      "Haven't seen ASIP, but I hear good things. Glenn Howerton, is that his name? He must hate Chris Pratt at this point.\n",
      "Yeah I would think he hates them haha. I actually like that show a lot though, you should check it out it's hilarious. It's cool that Chris Pratt was joking about being in Jurassic Park for back in 2010 and then he was, what a genius\n",
      "Spielberg knew talent when he saw it. Pratt has a great screen presence. I didn't like JP4, but I understand why they cast him.\n",
      "Yep I don't like the new Jurassic Park movies, but I'm glad that Chris Pratt is successful in them. I haven't really seen any of his other movies either, just Guardians of the Galaxy in Jurassic Park, it sounds like he's done a lot I'll have to check those out.\n",
      "Is he going to be in any other movies coming up? I hope there isn't another Jurassic movie.\n",
      "I'm not sure actually. I just know the Jurassic Park movies are horrible haha. I like the original one though, apparently the dinosaurs in that movie were only in the movie for about 15 minutes or so\n",
      "That was based on a book, so the plot was tight. I think the breakthru was the technology. Later, the stories were weak. \n",
      "Yep I agree with you. Also one thing that's cool about the first movie, is that it took 6 hours to render just one frame of the T-Rex in that movie. I wonder what it takes now.\n",
      "It was a stunning achievement in computer graphics. Spielberg had planned to use models, but the graphics were the best! The raptors were humans, though.\n",
      "Yep the Raptors were just humans in costumes haha. But they look great! It's crazy that the Jurassic Park ride cost twice as much as the actual movie LOL\n",
      "I want to go on the ride now. I bet it's really good! Probably scary like a horror film.\n",
      "I want to go on it too! Do you like any horror movies by the way?\n",
      "Not a big fan of horror, though I do like some of the movies based on Stephen King novels.\n",
      "Well Stephen King thought that Bambi was a horror movie, do you agree with him LOL?\n",
      "At a young age, I guess it could be scary. I don't remember seeing Bambi. I think his mom dies? That would be scary.\n",
      "You've never seen Bambi? You definitely have to see it, it is very sad though LOL. I need to watch more horror movies, you can burn up to 200 calories just from seeing it\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hello how are you?\n",
      "Good how are you? Do you like horror films?\n",
      "I do I did not know it exsisted for over a century\n",
      "Surprising that ET was originally supposed to be a horror movie\n",
      "i cannot believe that, and maybe if I watch it I can loose 180 calories\n",
      "Have you seen inception? That was supposed to be horror as well.\n",
      "No I have not seen it, is it any good?\n",
      "I saw it a long time ago so I don't remember much, but I remember I liked it\n",
      "I did watch jurrassic park and I thought the dinosaurs were in it for more than 15 minutes.\n",
      "I saw that too- kind of cool that an elephant roar was the primary sound used for the trex roar in the movie\n",
      "its hard to believe the fim only cost 63 million to make\n",
      "Even though it was called jurrasic park - the dinosaurs from the movie were almost all from the cretaceous period\n",
      "so I guesss jurrasic just sounded better then\n",
      "Yeah I guess so - I think sounds a lot better than \"cretaceous park\" haha\n",
      "chris Pratt sounds like a nice guy going to see sick children\n",
      "I haven't heard of that - is that a new movie he is in?\n",
      "No he is the actor and he goes and does charity work\n",
      "Oh oops I read your sentence wrong. Yeah that is nice of him.\n",
      "I wish some one could CGI a six pack on my body like, like chris pratt got offered\n",
      "He gained 40 pounds when he was dating Anna Faris because she likes to cook\n",
      "lol, it was nice talking to you\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you watch Hockey?\n",
      "Yes I do watch hockey. Do you ever watch the Special Olympics? Did you know that they first started back in 1968\n",
      "Wow, I did not know it has already been 50 years!\n",
      "Yes it's been a long time! And apparently they wrote about it in the newspapers and used language that would definitely not be politically correct today\n",
      "Yeah, imagine if social media was around then.  I knew Chicago was where it originated because my co was headquarted there.\n",
      "Oh that makes sense. What do you think about swimming by the way? You ever watch it on TV or in the Olympics\n",
      "I am terrible at self propulsion through water haha.  I like watching it on tv though\n",
      "Yeah swimming is fun to watch. It's crazy that there was a swimsuit that was banned because it was so good and in fact, it was used by 94% of all athletes in races haha\n",
      "The US has almost as many gold medals in swimming as the entire world combined!\n",
      "Why we must have some really good swimmers! And I know that Michael Phelps is really good, he has more gold medals than 80% of all countries in history lol\n",
      "Oh wow.  Cornell students must pass swimming test to graduate!\n",
      "That is interesting! I know that where I live you are also required to pass a swimming test in school, what is interesting too is that when people say that you can freestyle swim everyone just does the style called the front crawl because it is the most efficient\n",
      "How about bounding hands and feet and swim like a dolphin?\n",
      "That sounds really scary lol. Speaking of sports, what do you think about hockey? Did you know that the women's Olympic hockey team lost to a high school boys team\n",
      "Yeah, the Dolphin thing is a competition too.  That is crazy about the womens olympic team.\n",
      "Yeah that is very shocking. It's also shocking that back in 1932 India beat the United States 21 to 1 at hockey, I didn't even know they had a team haha\n",
      "Wow.  I would have quit.  Did you know they lose 8 lbs in one game of hockey?\n",
      "I didn't know that but that is awesome! Maybe I should take up hockey haha. Do you ever play tennis by the way\n",
      "I play it badly.  Did you know they used helicopters to dry the field in 69?\n",
      "Haha well that is a good idea. It's also weird though that before 1978 you could use any object as your tennis racket, and not just a designated tennis racket you could theoretically use a sledgehammer I guess haha\n",
      "Whoa, I would have used a car door then haha.  Nice talking to you.\n",
      "Yes nice talkin to you. Also make sure to watch the longest point in tennis history, it was a 643 shot volley that lasted for almost a half-hour lol\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hey did you know that Canada's national sports are hockey and lacrosse, would have just thought it was hockey personally haha\n",
      "I knew that hockey was their national sport, I didtnt know a country could have two lol, but its good to know. \n",
      "haha ya, I play tennis do you? the longest tennis match was spread over 3 days that is so long!\n",
      "Wow that is a long time to play a match, I wonder who won lol, after 3 days I guess both players wanted to give up, there hasnt been a black champion since 1968\n",
      "haha ya I would be so sad to be the loser, I like the ingenuity of using a helicopter to dry a grass tennis court though that would probably work great haha\n",
      "I agree lol, although that is an expensive way to dry a tennis court, do you know who Gael Monfils is?\n",
      "nope I haven't heard of him. What is he known for?\n",
      "Well he is tennis player and apparently a natural one, he learn how to play a few days beofre facing Federer and ended up winning the match, a lot of talent\n",
      "wow that is crazy! Federer is like one of the best too, I think it's funny that polo shirts were actually invented by a tennis player and not polo players\n",
      "Yeah he's a legend, imagine getting beat like a rookie in that way, and that is funny the name of the player was Rene Lacoste, wonder if he has anything to do with the Lacoste brand.\n",
      "haha ya he does, he invented the polo and was actually a tennis player which is cool, I wear polos all the time what about you?\n",
      "I do as well and it never crossed my mind a tennis player invented them, I wonder how much weight tennis players lose in a match? I know hockey players lose about 8, maybe its a similar physical effort\n",
      "ya that is a good point, tennis is very tiring I know I sweat a lot and definitely lose weight when I play, do you play any sports?\n",
      "I like to swim, I think its a great sport, works all the muscles in the body, what about you?\n",
      "well I do like to swim, I haven't swam in a long time though, I've heard that it burns a ton of calories because the water is cold and your body has to work hard to keep you warm too\n",
      "Yeah it does, its one of the most completes sports actually and you know the US is the leading country in swimming olympic gold medals\n",
      "nope I didn't know that, I do think it's weird that hockey rinks and basketball courts can switch spots easily, thats how they do it at sports stadiums\n",
      "Yeah, talk about taking advantage of a court lol, its good they use that space for other sports when hockey is not on season, \n",
      "ya that is a good use of space, crazy that canada scored 132 goals in the first olympic games, I wonder why they are so good at hockey \n",
      "Maybe because its one of its national sports, a lot of people interested in playing and a lot of support towards players\n",
      "that's true, I want to be the guy that was traded for $1 only to win 4 stanley cups later on the new team, his first team must feel really dumb for trading him haha\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Special Olympics were born in 1968\n",
      "I cant believe its been 50 years. Thats really awesome\n",
      "It is, the 50th anniversary was hosted in Chicago, I think its great to promote sports, disabled people have the right too.\n",
      "Yeah, im glad we are trying to end discrimination. Not just in sports but other aspects as well\n",
      "Yeah its a great thing, it demonstrates that the world choses to include everyone, Bank of America is one of the sponsors of the event.\n",
      "They have been helping out for 30 years!\n",
      "Its sad how 70% of Americans with disabilities seek employment but only a third of them find one, there should be more inclusion.\n",
      "At least bank of America is helping out. They have more than 300 individuals with disabilities on the support team.\n",
      "yeah they do contribute a lot and help a lot of disabled people, they provide work that has to do with warehousing, print services and others.\n",
      "Even 100 of the employees are athletes in the Special Olympics.\n",
      "Really that is so cool, I heard Erin Bailey is one of them and also Tyler Kennedy, both won medals at the Special Olympic games.\n",
      "Nearly 350k people with disabilities entered the workforce in 2016!\n",
      "I think its a good step, but more improvements need to be done, I think more businesses should follow the example of Bank of America then a real difference can be made.\n",
      "Do you know who to swim?\n",
      "I like swimming, not sure I understand your question but I do like it, \n",
      "I meant how! oops. Im a slow swimmer. I would like to try that banned suit.\n",
      "There is a banned swimming suit? I wonder why they did that, maybe its was an indiscreet suit.\n",
      "It won 94% off all races in the 2008 olympics. More than Michael Phelps has golds over countries!\n",
      "Oh so thats why, it makes sense to ban it after that, the US has also more gold medals than the rest of the countries combined\n",
      "NBA star Tim Duncan was almost an Olympic swimmer. But he was scared of sharks. Wonder which career he would of been better at.\n",
      "I have no idea I don't really know who he is I'm more of a tennis fan.\n",
      "Good talking with you have a great day!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Swimming is the best exercise and make muscle relax.\n",
      "Never really been into swimming myself.  My kids swim though, I'd like to get them one of those banned swimsuits that must make them go quicker.\n",
      "I also like swimming in river is very nice. You like to swim in pools or river.\n",
      "I used to prefer the sea until I got stung by a jellyfish.  Do you play any other sports, tennis maybe?\n",
      "I know some about tennis. Who is your favourite player.\n",
      "I've always liked Federer.  I once went to Wimbledon when I was in England, saw a whole bunch of tennis and can't remember a single players name.\n",
      "Ok. There is a type of competitive swimming where the athlete has their hands and legs bound, and swims like dolphin.\n",
      "That sounds like drowning to me! I like that Cornell University makes students pass a basic swim test.  Imagine being best in class and then failing because you can't swim.\n",
      "So only America scored more gold medals in swimming compared to the rest of the world..\n",
      "Like I said my kids swim, when we go to events there are so many kids doing it there must be millions in America.  Their coach says other countries don't take it a seriously.\n",
      "yes, It also very good habit for the teenager because While swimming we get more oxygen to brain it make ourself active and focused.\n",
      "Yeah, I like that the kids swim, it exercises all their limbs.\n",
      "Yes, It make more active brain and good habit are hard to form and it make self-discipline and focused on single thing.\n",
      "Have you ever player Hockey?  I'm not good on skates so it never tempted me, I'd be dangerous with a hockey stick in my hand.\n",
      "When i am kid was hit by hockey ball. On this incident i always only watch hockey. I am very afraid.\n",
      "Those pucks look dangerous flying around.  I understand that most other countries understand hockey to mean field hockey.  I guess it depend on if your country is cold or not.\n",
      "Canada is the only country in the world with two national sports, lacrosse and ice hockey.\n",
      "I guess they can't decide.  Just like the arenas that are both hockey and basketball, I wasn't aware they had the basketball court on top of the ice.\n",
      "Ice hockey is very interesting, but they are playing very aggressive\n",
      "I guess they sweat a lot, they can lose eight pounds in a game.\n",
      "Sure, They want to run throughout the game. \n",
      "I have to get the kids up, have a good day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you know that there is a type of competitive swimming where the athlete swims with their hands and legs bound like a dolphin?\n",
      "haha i did! but until recently i had no idea.\n",
      "That sounds hilarious to watch. I never realized that the swimming suit plays such a huge role in the swimmer's performance! Apparently one suit was so good that it's even banned!\n",
      "Yeah from the 2008 olympics right? I wonder how much it costs and what it even is made out of! Any clues?\n",
      "Yes, it made so many people win but I don't know why or how!\n",
      "hmm...very interesting. Do you like any other sports? \n",
      "Hockey is interesting! It's the national sport of Canada\n",
      "Did you know that the only country in the world to have two national sports is Canada? Hockey and Lacrosse! What is your favourite hockey team?\n",
      "Wow, I didn't know that I thought it was only hockey! Well, my favorite team is the US Olympic team I think! Apparently it's a really fit sport, too because players lose about 8 pounds per game!\n",
      "Yes, this is why they eat so many carbs before games. I hear players' favourite meal is chicken parm. Have you ever been to a hockey game?\n",
      "No I haven't been but maybe I have seen an ice hockey rink without realizing, since apparently they keep the ice hockey courts under basketball courts which I have been to!\n",
      "I've seen both and the speed at which the ice is covered is pretty cool. The world juniors are starting soon so I'm sure you'll be watching the US team!\n",
      "Yes I think I will! I also enjoy tennis, do you?\n",
      "I did much more when I was younger, but I don't really have time to follow too many sports. But I found out recently that polo shirts were first designed for tennis players and not for polo players as most people think!\n",
      "That's funny! I never though of those shirts as sports shirts at all since these days you see preppy people wear them a lot. I think tennis is so interesting because games can even run as long as eleven hours!\n",
      "I don't know if I would be able to watch a game for 11 hours, I get too into games so it would drain me.\n",
      "Well luckily that game actually was stretched out over three days so you could get some rest in between\n",
      "That's true. What's your favourite sport?\n",
      "I think my favorite sport is probably gymnastics or lacrosse, which like we talked about before is one of Canada's national sports. How about you?\n",
      "Oh I really like gymnastics. Always watch them during the summer olympics. But my favourite sport is definitely hockey ha! I really like that we have talked about sports so much. \n",
      "Me too! Thanks and Merry Christmas!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you enjoy movies?\n",
      "Not as much as I use to.  U.S. movies tend to be strong on special effect and weak on acting.  I do like a good sci-fi that is well acted.\n",
      "I enjoy how scifi films incorporate fictional science based depictions of phenomena that boggles peoples minds.\n",
      "I agree, but not something so far-fetched its unbelievable.  I like the science to be futuristic, but realistic enough to appear attainable.  I also like sci-fi based on books, like Hunger Games.\n",
      "How about more serious films like a space odyssey?\n",
      "Space Odyssey is based on a short story titled \"The Sentinel\".  So, it has a place on my favorites lists.  How about Sci-Fi books?  2018 had some winners.\n",
      "I tend to watch scifi movies more. Did you know that scifi films have become even more popular since star wars and nasa even has a list of accurate space terms to help writers write scifi stories?\n",
      "Considering the imaginary concepts (e.g. Star Trek transporter), I think it is good that NASA emphasizes real definitions for actual terms and concepts.  What I find interesting is that some Sci-Fi actors may no longer be regular actors but still have high earning at conventions signing autographs, etc.\n",
      "Well that explains why fan conventions are tremendously lucrative for actors, making 100K+ in one weekend\n",
      "I wonder if the NASA list has a definition for \"Hyperloop\"?  As of late, I have not heard much about Elon Musk's hyperloop tunnel in SoCal.  Do you think it will work?\n",
      "Elon Muzk has founded many innovative companies and the hyperloop tunnel was such a type of plan he would have. I have rather been hearing more about his aerospace company spaceX\n",
      "SpaceX id definitely a leader in private space transportation and exploration.  It also highlights Elon's weird (and expensive) sense of humor.  Did you know he short a cheese wheel into space as a tribute to Monty Python's cheese shop sketch?\n",
      "I guess he has interest in improv and acting. He even produced and acted in thank you for smoking.\n",
      "It also seems like the acting bug bit his wife as well.  She made an appearance in the \"Inception\" movie.  Are you interested in being one of the first to join Elon's first transport to colonize Mars?\n",
      "The first perhaps, but I think I would much rather go to mars after everything is proven to work\n",
      "So true,  The first traveler will be true explorers, going in knowing that success, if it occurs, will be a hard fought struggle.  But, then perhaps they can ask the alien commander from 3rd Rock from the Sun for survival tips... LOL\n",
      "Who knows? Maybe they will teach Elon musk how to build a vertical take off supersonic, electric passenger jet that he so desires to build\n",
      "He does have a vivid imagination and deep enough pockets to dream that big.  But, some of his antics are humorous.  In a way they remind me of a old British comedy Sci Fi TV series \"Red Dwarf\".\n",
      "I enjoy the Red Dwarf too. I enjoy comedy in general since it encourages laughter and focuses on humor.\n",
      "Agreed.  I have a reading list on my e-reader.  Glancing over it, I see I am weak in Sci-Fi.  So, I am thinking of adding some new releases.  Have you read any write-ups / reviews for \"Sophia of Silicon Valley\"?  \n",
      "I recently heard that that it offers a surprising insider's look, also succeeding as a roman clef. In any case, I will also consider reading this book. Thank you for your time chatting today\n",
      "I like the way the author has rubbed shoulders with Steve Jons and Elon Musk.  She probably got good insights from people accustom to \"pushing the boundaries\".\n",
      "Indeed. Another reason I will check out the book\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you ever watched Deadpool?\n",
      "Oh, yeah, I've seen them both! Really enjoyed them, although some of the \"fourth wall\" breaks got a little over the top in the second one... still, lots of fun!\n",
      "It's the highest grossing r-rated film of all time.I haven't watched it yet. Looks scary.\n",
      "Hmm... weird.. could have SWORN Passion of the Christ was the highest grossing R rated film... but maybe not..\n",
      "Is it an r-rated film?\n",
      "Passion?  Yes, it is.  It was very controversial for being rather graphically violent.  (Some argued gratuitously so.)  You know, speaking of Deadpool, crazily enough the video game cost more to make than the movie!\n",
      "That is crazy.\n",
      "Yeah, a LOT of money goes into the development of video games these days.  In many ways they're bigger businesses than movies!\n",
      "Yes, true. It use to be just toys based upon movies. Now the video games have a life of their own.\n",
      "Oh, speaking of superheros.. did you know even Garfield was a superhero for awhile?\n",
      "I use to watch Garfield but didn't know that.\n",
      "I didn't either, and I used to read the books when I was younger.  They had a book series spinoff called Pet Force which had him as his friends as superheros... \n",
      "I've read that too.\n",
      "Speaking of superheros and all that.. did you know that Stan Lee (RIP) wrote 15 DC comics?  I never knew he'd ever written for DC...\n",
      "I don't know Stan Lee. Who is that?\n",
      "He's the guy who created the X-Men, Fantastic Four, Spiderman, and one of the original writers of Marvel comics.  He also had a cameo in all the Marvel movies.\n",
      "Wow\n",
      "But yeah, he was a big star in the comic book/superhero world.  And speaking of stars, do you know there are stars that are cold enough to be touch by the human hand?  Weird to think about when you consider our sun is a star...\n",
      "I've read that. Do you think earth was ever a star?\n",
      "I got my doubts, but dunno enough about it to say for sure.  I've heard somewhere that it was once a lot smaller and got hit by a large asteroid which upped it's mass a whole bunch...\n",
      "Maybe I will look into that. It was nice chatting with you. Have a great afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good morning, have you seen Deadpool 2?\n",
      "Actually, I haven't. I've been meaning to, but I am watching the MCU in order, and haven't made it to his movies yet. Ironically, the Deadpool video game was more expensive to make than the movies.\n",
      "I haven't seen it either, but I want to. I saw Deadpool described himself as Ryan Reynolds crossed with a sharpee.\n",
      "That was what lead to Reynolds thinking he was getting the role. Nothing like literally having it drawn out for you.\n",
      "Agreed lol. The voice of the mystery villain is actually Ryan Reynolds.\n",
      "Have you read any of the Garfield Pet Force comics?\n",
      "I have not. Are they any good?\n",
      "They are cute. Garfield and his friends are superheroes.\n",
      "Oh very cool. I would like to read that then. I saw there is a comic series about fixing collateral damage created by superheroes.\n",
      "I haven't heard of that one. Have you heard of Normalman?\n",
      "I have not heard of Normalman. Who is that?\n",
      "He is the only person on a planet without super powers.\n",
      "Very cool. What super powers does he have?\n",
      "Well, as he is the only one without any, he has none.\n",
      "Ahh ok I just saw he didn't have powers. That would be lonely then lol.\n",
      "I doubt it, he has plenty of company. There are over 300 superheroes registered in the US. I'm sure hes friends with many.\n",
      "Wow that's a lot. Do you know much about the universe?\n",
      "Not too much, other than there is  theory regarding the universe being one giant hologram.\n",
      "I have heard that too. There is a theory that the universe only has one electron.\n",
      "I guess there are some stars that are cold enough to be touched.\n",
      "Definitely. Well, it was good chatting with you. Take care. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hey did you see the movie Deadpool 2?\n",
      "Yes, I did!  I loved both Deadpool movies!  I think it is hilarious in  2004 that Deadpool described himself as a cross between Ryan Reynolds and a sharpei!\n",
      "haha ya I'm so glad they got him in the role, I was happy that both are rated R and not pg-13\n",
      "Yes, the most surprising part by far of the first movie was how inappropriate it was.  I loved that!\n",
      "lol yup I agree, I like it much more than the Avergers movies\n",
      "Me too.  You know a movie is going to be good when both James Cameron and David Fincher read the script and champion the project.\n",
      "you're right about that theyre both great directors, do you know who did the mystery villain voice at the end of deadpool 2 btw?\n",
      "I do actually!  It was Ryan Reynolds!  \n",
      "haha yes! did you play the deadpool game btw? Its actually really good and cost more to make than teh first movie!\n",
      "I have not played it, maybe I should check it out.  That is shocking considering Deadpool is the highest grossing R rated movie not directed by George Lucas or James Cameron!\n",
      "haha it is shocking! what other superheroes do you like? apparently there are 300 that are registered in the USA which is a lot to choose from\n",
      "I was am a huge fan of all the Batman movies.  I would have loved to see Garfield as a superhero.  There was a spinoff of Garfield named Pet Force which featured a gang of superheros along with Garfield.\n",
      "haha ya that sounds cool to me! did you know stan lee actually made some comics for DC? Im shocked he alwayd did stuff only with marvel\n",
      "That is really cool  I was very saddened to hear that Stan Lee passed away a few weeks ago.  He was a pioneer.\n",
      "ya I agree I miss him, I want to read the comic about the the collateral damage that is caused by superheroes that sounds interesting\n",
      "That does sound interesting.  I am more interested to learn about normalman, the only person on a planet of superheros without power.\n",
      "lol I would read that too, what do you think about our universe though, do we live in a big hologram?\n",
      "It is so deep to even contemplate.  Some say that only one electron exists in the universe.  Mind boggling stuff!\n",
      "yes I agree! I don't know how that works, or how a star could be so cold that you could touch it!\n",
      "Some scientists think that, like Earth, universes are subject to natural selection and darwinism.  Puts a whole new spin on things!\n",
      "wow yes it does! I also wish we could explore outerspace more, there is apparently a part of outer space that is pulling on our currenty galaxy\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hi how are you? what do you think of this universe of ours?\n",
      "I think the universe is very fascinating! what about you?\n",
      "I love learning about science. i think it is interesting to hear all the theories of the universe.\n",
      "I agree. Have you heard about the theory with the universe and natural selection\n",
      "I guess it makes sense? better universes with better laws and constants would be more robust?\n",
      "Yes, it is crazy to think that universes evolve through natural selection much like different species do on earth. I have never thought about it like that. \n",
      "I wonder how our universe is doing. is it going to be around for another billion years? lets hope so.\n",
      "I hope so too! Have you heard that the universe may be one giant superhologram?\n",
      "if so, then are we just tiny holograms? am i chatting with a hologram?\n",
      "I hope not! That is freaky to think about.\n",
      "We could all just be illusions. some god dreams, and we are part of the holo-dream.\n",
      "That is crazy. Have you heard about cold stars?\n",
      "I have not. cold stars? i thought stars were hot.\n",
      "I did too. But apparently there are stars in the known universe that are cold enough to be touched by the human hand.\n",
      "i guess that could be interesting. i would rather mars. or the moon.\n",
      "I would love to touch a star!\n",
      "I think that stars are fascinating. many people do not know that our sun is star. \n",
      "I know. I feel like you learn that in middle school though. \n",
      "Yes, they should know that, but some people sleep through most of school. anyway, great chat.\n",
      "Haha true. I bet Sir Isaac Newton did not sleep in school!\n",
      "He was a genius. Have a good day!\n",
      "You too! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello\n",
      "Hi. How are you? I was just reading a new novel about the wired life.\n",
      "Yes. Tech has become part of most peoples daily lives\n",
      "It's amazing that SiFi has become our new norm.  Mobile phones and genetic modification are things we are accustomed to.\n",
      "I am someone who does not like to go out without my phone\n",
      "Me too.  Especially since I have my Kindle app on it, with all my books.  Right now I'm reading The Oracle Year by Charles Soule.  Have you heard of him?  He worked on Daredevil and Death of Wolverine.\n",
      "No. But I have heard those titles before.\n",
      "I'm so into Sci-Fi.  I love that it depicts phenomena that is not fully accepted by the mainstream, but still uses scientific plausibility and plot logic.\n",
      "I like sci fi films. I always look for new sci fi movies or series\n",
      "Any in particular you like?  2001: A Space Odyssey is still my fav.\n",
      "The first star wars But I like most sci fi movies if they are decent\n",
      "Any authors you like?  Bethanne Patrick has a good collection of authors in \"The Books That Changed My Life\"\n",
      "I have not heard of that I will check it out\n",
      "I hope you let me know how you like it.  You might like \"The Feed\" too.\n",
      "I think thats going to be a series on Amazon \n",
      "Is it?  I would def watch it.\n",
      "Yes. it premiers this year sometime\n",
      "Can you imagine IM in someone's head?\n",
      "Yes thats really something\n",
      "Any other movies, books, or shows that you are into?  \n",
      "I liked the lost series on tv\n",
      "That was a beautiful show, both in the writing and visually.  It's probably the best bit of TV Sci-Fi since 1997.\n",
      "Yes I thought so too\n",
      "It's been nice chatting with you, but I'd better get back to work.\n",
      "you too\n",
      "Let me know how you like the new Sci-Fi stuff you check out, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi there are you a Star Wars fan?\n",
      "I am! Are you?  Have you seem the  young Han Solo movie?\n",
      "I have seen it.  Actually watched on Netflix recently.  I liked it!\n",
      "Nice!  I have not seen it yet.  I was just reading a review on it actually. \n",
      "It's worth checking out.  The combined box office revenues from all the Star Wars films have brought in over $8.5 billion dollars!\n",
      "That is a lot of money!  Did you know that 20th Century Fox agreed to forgo a $500k directing fee to let Lucas keep the licensing and merchandise rights?\n",
      "I wonder how they feel about that now.  Lucas pulled one over on them.  The entire franchise is estimated to be $65 billion dollars!\n",
      "I know! It has cost them billions and made Lucas himself a billionaire.\n",
      "Cha-ching!  His wife Marcia, won an academy award for editing the first movie!\n",
      "That she did.  George however did not win for directing.\n",
      "Right!  James Earl Jones only spent 2.5 hours recording all of the lines for Darth Vader's voice for the first movie.\n",
      "Yup, and he was paid $7500 for it.  Not bad for 2.5 hours worth of work!\n",
      "Not too shabby.  lol  Did you know that Han Solo was a tie fighter pilot prior to piloting the Millennium Falcon?\n",
      "I did not know that actually.  Did you know he was an Imperial lieutenant before his friendship with Chewy?\n",
      "I did know that!  You didn't see the movie yet so I won't want to spoil how he became one. LOL\n",
      "LOL! I appreciate that!\n",
      "\n",
      "lol  Christopher Walken was considered by George Lucas for the part of Han Solo in the original movie.  He might have been pretty good in that role.\n",
      "Probably would.  Al Pacino turned it down because he could not understand the script.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you know any facts about planets you would like to share?\n",
      "If Jupiter's moon Ganymede orbited the Sun it would be considered a planet!\n",
      "Now that's interesting!  I had a good time chatting with you!\n",
      "I did too!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good evening. Did you see the new Solo Star Wars movie? I thought it was great!\n",
      "I thought it was okay... I'm curious to see what the original directors were doing with the product before they got fired for \"creative differences\".  \n",
      "Yeah me too. I just love Star Wars in general. I especially loved the first one in released in 1977!\n",
      "Yeah, it was a huge part of my childhood growing up!  They say the whole franchise is worth like $65 billion now\n",
      "I believe it. Apparently George Lucas' wife had some input on the films.\n",
      "Yeah, I heard that!  Many have stated that it was her editing and idea inputs that really saved the first film.  She even won an award for editing the first movie.  They maybe should have brought her in for the prequels!\n",
      "Wow yeah she deserves all of that. Star Wars was the first major film dubbed in Native American. It really is popular in all cultures.\n",
      "Like him or not, you gotta admit Lucas's business smarts.  He forgoed a $500k fee on Star Wars to keep the merchandising (ie toy) rights.  That move made him a BILLIONAIRE.  Cause, what kid didn't want those toys in the 80s?\n",
      "Wow interesting. Yeah a major powerhouse. James Earl Jones was only paid 7500 for voicing Vader! He missed out!\n",
      "Speaking of Star Wars, could you imagine Bill Murray in the role of Solo?  They say he auditioned for it!  \n",
      "Haha no way. I'm glad he didn't get it. Al Pacino also auditioned and turned down the role.\n",
      "Dunno if it's true, but I heard somewhere Nick Nolte also audition.  That might have been kind of funny... esp since he always has one scene in every film where he gets all exasperated with everything... lol\n",
      "Haha hilarious so true. Add Christopher Walken to the list as well as he was considered!\n",
      "I read in an early draft that Han Solo was supposed to MARRIED to a Wookie.  The heck?!/\n",
      "Haha that would have made things interesting. I like the star wars world but I also think our planetary system is interesting. Venus for example, does not have any seasons!\n",
      "I did not know that!  Yeah, the space is really interesting.  Did you know you could git every other planet between earth and the moon?  As Douglas Adams once said, \"Space is big, really big!\"\n",
      "Whoa very smart words. Jupiter's moon would be considered a planet if only it orbited the sun!\n",
      "Speaking of Jupiter, do you know it would be impossible to have manned space stations in it's orbit because of all the radiation the planet emits?  \n",
      "Oh that sounds very cancerous. Interesting. Uranus doesn't though and it actually rolls around the sun.\n",
      "Speaking of rotating, there's a planet that orbits FOUR different stars.  Gotta google that sometime..\n",
      "\n",
      "Wow I def need to look that up. But I also need to stay away from the planet that precipitates shards of glass. Well it was lovely talking with you I hope you have a great evening. Goodnight!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you seen the young Han Solo movie?  It is great!\n",
      "Yes, I thought so too.  I just read something that said the robot was the best part.  I don't agree. \n",
      "Nah I really like Alden playing Han Solo - he's young and handome\n",
      "He did a good job.  I thought the cinematography was excellent too.  I don't understand how it got such a bad review.\n",
      "I am not sure - I loved Chewbacca as well - what a great character!\n",
      "Yeah.  Maybe people expected a total Star Wars duplicate.  It's its own movie.  It did have a George Lucas feel to it...\n",
      "Without a doubt - it is a new story.  They had bradford young doing cinemagraphy - it has to be good right?\n",
      "Yep.  I was surprised to learn that James Cameron was a truck driver that, after seeing Star Wars, decided to get into the film industry. \n",
      "That is pretty crazy.  All of the first 8 movies in the series were nominated for Academy Awards - that is amazing for a bunch of sequals\n",
      "Yes it is.  George Lucas said that the whole Star Wars saga is told by R2D2 about 100 years after the Return of the Jedi.  I didn't know that!\n",
      "I had never heard that either!  What a great idea!  The series holds the Guinness World record for the most successful film merchandising franchise.  They have sold a ton!\n",
      "So many things have been produced for Star Wars.  DId you ever see the Family Guy versions?  So funny...\n",
      "I have not - that is pretty unique.  I think its funny that Al Pacino could have been Han Solo but he turned the role down\n",
      "Also Bill Murray auditioned for the part.  I just can't see anyone but H. Ford now. \n",
      "For sure - though if George Lucas had made Han Solo a large green alien maybe so\n",
      "Or a wookie.  In the original Star Wars I guess he was secretly married to one. \n",
      "He was secretly married to a wookie?  Really?  Was Chewbacca jealous?\n",
      "I hope not.  I would hate to see him angry.  I loved Firefly, there is supposed to be a toy Han Solo in every episode.  I totally missed that.\n",
      "I have never noticed a toy.   I wonder what solar system they were in?  It seemed to have a lot more than our own 8/9\n",
      "Don't know.  Apparently there is a planet that orbits 4 stars. That must be one weird orbit.\n",
      "That would be a very weird orbit - I wonder if it tilts or has seasons?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you like Star Wars?\n",
      "Of course. Who doesn't?\n",
      "What did you think of Solo: A Star Wars Story?\n",
      "While I am a fan of the franchise, I heard that it failed to gross more than 29million\n",
      "Yeah,and it only had one third the size of its normal audience during opening weekend.\n",
      "While I don't think the quantity of people of who watch a movie during the opening weekend is any accurate indicator, I have heard mix reviews of the movie\n",
      "Some people think it's a bad omen for the Star Wars franchise and the rest of Hollywood because it tells about consumer's moviegoing behavior.\n",
      "True. When a major release is having such a low turnout, it usually means the worth of mouth and interest is lacking.\n",
      "The big drop on the second weekend also tells a lot.\n",
      "Indeed. It is especially troubling when there were no other major releases since at that problem its a you problem\n",
      "Yes, this ratio has been very accurate in predicting the overall box office of the spring and summer period.\n",
      "Do you think there is an emerging trend of less people interested in seeing films immediately after they are released in movie theaters?\n",
      "I think so. Is Netflix to blame? I know I'm not interested in going to the movies anymore!\n",
      "I don't know. Personally I do enjoy going to watch movies in theaters, but I don't feel an need to go as soon as it is released. \n",
      "Then again, what about the success of Black Panther and Avengers Infinity War?\n",
      "Perhaps Marvel is just doing better than star wars\n",
      "They made that box office year up seven percent. It's a similar ternd for the year before but by August things had cratered out and the box office was down.\n",
      "Currently, the star wars franchise is worth 65 billion. I wonder how these recent releases will affect the star wars franchise\n",
      "It's the fifth highest grossing media franchise. I would have thought it would be higher on that list\n",
      "I mean George Lucas became a billionaire off the merchandising rights along for the original star wars\n",
      "He has his wife to thank for some of the little details in the original star wars film. She got the academy award for editing the film.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello do you like or watch movies?\n",
      "When I can. I prefer to watch TV series though. How about you?\n",
      "I like both.  Did you know disney considered shutting down their animation studio after sleeping beauty was a failure?\n",
      "I didn't know it was a failure in the box office since I loved it as a little kid. Disney doesn't always make the best choices though. Its treasure planet was the most expensive box office flop of all time.\n",
      "ouch,  that sucks.  although,  I never watched it.  What disney movies do you like?\n",
      "I like all of the animated ones, haha. I guess Tom Hanks does not know about box office failure. He is the highest earning box office star of all time.\n",
      "Good for him.  He is a great actor,  I cant even think of a movie he is in that sucked lol \n",
      "It's difficult to predict what will flop and what won't though. 20th Century Fox was convinced that Star Wars was going to flop. George Lucas said that he would forgo a $500K directing fee so he could keep licensing and merchandising rights. The decision cost fox billions\n",
      "Since valentines day is coming up,  I heard Silence of the Lambs came out on v day in 1991 and made 270 mil at the box office hahaha that doesnt seem like a valentines day movie. \n",
      "No it does not, haha, though,  I wouldn't mind watching a superhero movie like Avengers Infinity War. It's the first film to be shot entirely with digital imax cameras.\n",
      "That was a great movie,  the second one is coming out soon!  You should watch the others to catch up lol\n",
      "Yeah, that sounds like a fun Valentine's Day actually. The Avengers caused an increase in shawarma sales. Did they eat shawarma in the movie?\n",
      "hahaha Tony Stark says it at the end of one of the avenger movies that he wants to eat shawarma after a huge battle,  i think they show him eating shawarma a few times after that\n",
      "Interesting. I remember watching the original hulk when I was little. The actor who played the hulk in that series has been voicing the characters for decades.\n",
      "Yeah probably the only way he gets work,  I havent seen him in anything else. \n",
      "Speaking of voice work, the voice actor who played Jarvis in the Iron Man series has never actually seen the films.\n",
      "yeah thats pretty funny.  He has a good voice. \n",
      "The waitress that Captain America saves in the Avengers was also the voice of Gretchen in Recess\n",
      "I actually dont know that show recess, and I dont think I know that actress,  is she good?\n",
      "I am not really sure. Interesting how there is a lot of overlap in voice work and acting though.\n",
      "its been fun talking to you,  have a good one, bye. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Were you aware that Solo: A Star Wars Story did not do well at the box office?\n",
      "I know because the movie  barely made 29 millions.\n",
      "Well it made that on it's second weekend. Unfortunately that was a 65 percent plummet from the week before. Those numbers are horrible for a film of that caliber. \n",
      "What do you think Star Wars franchise would think about?\n",
      "I believe that they may have over saturated the market with a new movie every year. I also think that not that many people want to see Han Solo portrayed by anyone that is not Harrison Ford. \n",
      "Do you know that usually above 60 perfect means the opposite?\n",
      "Yes apparently a slip of 60% between weeks one and two is not good. This is especially bad here since it went up against no other blockbusters. But a slip of less than 50 percent on the second week is considered good so 65% is quite bad.\n",
      "There is too much to know about hollywood. do you know that a  box office is also a ticket office? \n",
      "No I was not aware of that. The box office for the year was up 7% was is good for the business. A Quiet Place was a sleeper hit and I quite enjoyed that movie. \n",
      "Good. It is also fascinating how a movie can be a flop in some countries can be a broke box office. For example John Carter was not good at all for Disney, but in Russia was a broke box office.\n",
      "Yes I am always surprised about what a movie does internationally. It seems to me that many action movies that bomb here made their money back overseas. \n",
      "True. Star Wars has been for awhile.  We talking about back in the 70's. I am not  a fan. I am impressed it has been for so long and fans are crazy about it.\n",
      "I don't have any nostalgia for them myself because I didn't watch them repeatedly as a child so I tend to like the new ones more which I know is blasphemy in the fan community. \n",
      "Hahahaha! Fox must have been so desappointed when they accpeted  George proposition to forgo an additional 500k directing fee, thinking that the movie was going to flop\n",
      "Oh no. That was a bad choice on his part. Although I am positive he has made more than enough money. Kind of off of the subject, were you aware that Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office star at $8.5 billion worldwide in film earnings?\n",
      "Didn´t know that. It is so incredible how actors and actress can make so much money just for a movie. I still cant believe that star Wars in 2008 made 65 billions of dollars. \n",
      "Yes it is a very lucrative industry. I wish our teachers and fire fighters could make more money but I suppose there is not as much money in it. I was surprised to learn that James Earl Jones only made $7,500 for voicing Darth Vader's lines for Star Wars. His voice is so iconic. \n",
      "They should be. You have to study harder to be a teacher and you dont get paid enough for it. At least James still made some money. But it is most incredible that the actor who played in iron man series and avengers hasn't seen the films.\n",
      "That is shocking. Some people have a hard time watching themselves so I hope that's the only reason. \n",
      "hahahaha..It is so hilarious to know that Robert Downey used to hide food on the sets. It has to be hard to be an actor. \n",
      "Wow! That seems unnecessary with craft services. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you like the Star Wars series?\n",
      "Good afternoon.  Yes, I do like Star Wars.  How about you?\n",
      "I liked the first three films. The ones after that, not so much. I'm amazed that Al Pacino turned down the role of Han Solo because he couldn't understand the script.\n",
      "Not the great Al Pacino? I'm glad he turned it down, I can't picture him being Hans Solo!\n",
      "George Lucas originally intended Solo to be either a large green alien or a black man. I figure Sam Jackson would have been good for that. \n",
      "Yes, he would have.  He would have put his extra special spin on it for sure. I had heard that Christopher Walken had been considered by George Lucas as Han in the original Star Wars and I can't picture him, either.\n",
      "Walken is a bit too dark. Maybe something imperial for him? Then again, Han Solo was an imperial lieutenant before his companionship with Chewbacca.\n",
      "I didn't know that!  I still find it hard to believe that 20th Century Fox thought Star Wars would flop.\n",
      "Lucas had done a tremendous film before Star Wars. I don't know why they thought a sci fi film would do badly. Maybe they didn't understand the story.\n",
      "Well, that was a big mistake on their part, but it made him a billionaire.\n",
      "licensing and merchandising rights for 500k. Lucas knew that the toys and t-shirts would sell.\n",
      "You know, I still have my original Star Wars lunchbox and thermos from when I was a good.  It's in pretty rough shape, but I would never part with it!\n",
      "Too many memories. Too much nostalgia. James earl jones spent only 2.5 hours recording all of darth vader's lines for star wars and was paid $7,500. I wonder how much he made on residuals.\n",
      "I hope more than $7500, that seems like a low amount for such an Icon of the franchise.  Everybody knows Darth Vader's voice!\n",
      "In 2013, Star Wars was dubbed in Navajo, making it the first major film to be dubbed in a Native American language. I wonder if JEJ had anything to do with that.\n",
      "IDK, I wonder if James Earl Jones had anything to do with that, as well?\n",
      "Could be. Maybe he learned to pronounce Navajo. He has such a distinct voice.\n",
      "I wonder if George ever got mad because his ex wife, Marcia won an Academy award for Star Wars and he didn't?  That's kind of funny.\n",
      "I guess that could be a source of tension over the years. He really never got recognition from the Academy, but I guess he'll have to make do with billions.\n",
      "I'm sure he's crying all the way to the bank, as well.  But, I'm sure she got her share of that too!\n",
      "I guess so. Anyway, great chat!\n",
      "Great chatting with you as well.  Good day!\n",

      "Hi how are you today?\n",
      "good, do you like to read ?\n",
      "Yes i do. Have you ever read macbeth?\n",
      "No, but i have heard that Jo Nesbo just wrote a version of McBeth set in 70s in Northern England.\n",
      "His \"Macbeth\" takes place in 1970s Northern England, where a drug lord named Hecate (a stand-in for the three witches) defies both Police Chief Duncan and Inspector Macbeth.\n",
      "Do you like Shakespeare ?\n",
      "Yes a little bit. He is often called England's national poet and the \"Bard of Avon\".\n",
      "He is a great dramatist that influenced a lot of people, like Joe Nesbo. \n",
      "Pocahontas and shakespeare were alive at the same time and died only a year apart. Thats kinda amazing if you think about it.\n",
      "To think he invented the names of Miranda, Jessica and Olivia, he was good at giving names. \n",
      "Yes that a cool fact also. Do you like being out in the sun?\n",
      "Yes, I do like the sun, I like the heat, especially in winter. \n",
      "I love sunflowers and summer so much.\n",
      "But it is surprising that a lightening bolt is hotter than the sun. \n",
      "Yes but it does The sun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy\n",
      "The universe is so big, even in our solar system, Neptune just completed its first orbit around the sun since 1846, the year of its discovery. \n",
      "Yes I read that Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers, or 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth the sun is . So cool.\n",
      "Also it is so massive that the energy created from its reaction take between 10 000 and 170 000 to get to its surface.\n",
      "wow its been nice talking to you. Thanks.\n",
      "You too, what do you think about Jane Austen ? Mark Twain did not like her. \n",
      "Yes I like what I read. Talk to ya later.\n",

      "Wow!  Do you follow tennis?  They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 us open\n",
      "Cool! I love tennis! Until 1978 a tennis player could use ANY item as a racket! How strange!\n",
      "That is very strange!  The longest tennis match was 11 hours over 3 days.\n",

      "The sun is quite fascinating. Don't you agree?\n",
      "Absolutely. It is a hot star at the center of the Solar System, after all.\n",
      "It is. Did you know it is actually white and only appears yellow?\n",
      "Oh, is that because of the atmosphere?\n",
      "Yes it is due to atmospheric scattering. I was also surprised to learn that a lightening bolt is actually hotter than the sun. It makes me wonder how anyone has survived a lightening strike. \n",
      "Wow. On July 11  2011 there was a full orbit of the sun when Neptune completed its first rotation since it was discovered.\n",
      "WOW! I knew it was far out there but I did not realize it's orbit took that long. Shockingly, the sun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy. I can't imagine the scope of the largest, \n",
      "The sun is 1.39 million kilometers still. So it's rather big.\n",
      "That's huge. So the largest star discovered in our galaxy s 1 billion times larger than that! I can't wrap my brain around that size. \n",
      "Indeed. I wonder if William Shakespeare wrote about the sun. He was very famous.\n",
      "His work holds up too. Did you know that he coined many of the phrases we use today such as;  \"good riddance. in my heart of hearts. laughing stock. wild-goose chase. devil incarnate. brave new world. as luck would have it. all our yesterdays. break the ice. full circle.\" \n",
      "Ah. He invented Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia as women's names also.\n",
      "I was not aware of that. I like all of those names. I find it very shocking that Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time and died only a year apart.\n",
      "That's intriguing. Jane Austen was very famous too\n",
      "Yes she was and is. I am much less familiar with her works. I know that she wrote Emma and that Clueless was based on that book. \n",
      "Yes. Three novels she had written were rejected when they were sent to major publishing companies under a different name in 2007.\n",
      "WOW! I'm sure they felt stupid later. I was not aware that Mark Twain hated Pride and Prejudice. It's arguably as famous as any of his classics.\n",
      "Yeah. They both like to use the word literally as hyperbole.\n",
      "And we all really hate it when people do that now ha ha. \n",
      "Yes. It's interesting they pioneered a lot of what is done now.\n",
      "They certainly did. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello,  how are you?  Did you know Shakespeare coined or popularized many of the phrases we use today. some of these include: \"good riddance. in my heart of hearts. laughing stock. wild-goose chase. devil incarnate. brave new world. as luck would have it. all our yesterdays. break the ice. full circle.\"\n",
      "no, i didn't. But I did now that he and Pocahontas died only one year apart\n",
      "yeah thats interesting.  This one is kinda weird: Polish composer Andr√© Tchaikowsky donated his skull to the royal shakespeare company in hopes that it would be used as a prop for the skull of yorick. in 2008, the skull was used in a series of performances of hamlet at the courtyard theatre, stratford-upon-avon. \n",
      "  That is weird.  However it's pretty cool that Shakespeare invented the names Olivia, Jessica, and Miranda.\n",
      "Yeah I had no idea.  Those are very popular names too!\n",
      "Yes, without him, they wouldn't be there.  Switching topics, did you know the Sun is actually white?  We see it as yellow because of the atmospheric scattering.\n",
      "Yes i did.  Very interesting.  A lightening bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun, about 5x hotter. Thats crazy.\n",
      "This is crazy. Something else that is crazy is that the sun produces enough energy to power our entire planet for 500,000 years in just one second.\n",
      "Yeah,  a lot of people in my area are converting to solar panels!  \n",
      "I would but it's too expensive.  we think the sun is big, but it is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star we known of in our galaxy.\n",
      "Some of my friends say their bill is like $20 per month or less!  I live in an apartment.  yeah thats insanely huge!\n",
      "I just can't afford to convert.  Wish I could.  Also, Neptune just completed its first full orbit around the sun since it was discovered in 1846. \n",
      "Yeah right,  what a slow orbiting planet!  \n",
      "I would be so young there, lol.  Are you a movie fan.  I am a big movie buff.  For instance, Clueless the movie is loosely based on Jane Auston's \"Emma\".\n",
      "Nice!  I didnt know that. Mark twain hated jane austen's \"pride and prejudice\"\n",
      "I didn't know that.  Well, three of her novels were rejected when they were sent to major publishing companies under different names in 2004.\n",
      "Interesting. The word \"literally\" has been used figuratively for hundreds of years. charles dickens, charlotte bront√´, jane austen, and mark twain all used it for hyperbole.\n",
      "That is a cool fact.   the lord of the rings by j. r. r. tolkien; pride and prejudice by jane austen; his dark materials by philip pullman; and the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy by douglas adams, were the top four novels voted on by the BBC in the UK in 2003.\n",
      "Nice!  Those are great books! \n",
      "Yes they are.  Jane Austin works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. Not my cup of tea.\n",
      "great talking to you,  have a good one!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There were sure some rave reviews about that Teen Titans movie!\n",
      "yes its awesome\n",
      "I wasn't interested in seeing it at first but the reviewer really loved the music and sense of humor. He (or she?) made a good point that it's great even for adults. \n",
      "The original teen titans from like 15 years ago was fantastic when I was a kid so I wasnt such a big fan of the newer one until i saw the film. What cartoons did you like as a kid.\n",
      "I was a sucker for Looney Tunes, and also stuff like Superman. It's interesting to see how the whole superhero genre has evolved and become a lot more serious now. \n",
      "Looney tunes was the best and so was tom and jerry I always loved daffy duck alot of medern day cartoons are based on his antics\n",
      "Daffy and Bugs are timeless!! It's funny seeing Tom and Jerry through more adult eyes; they aren't quite as funny as they seemed back then. Remember a few years back when they made a live-action movie involving the Looney Tunes character with some live action (I think Shaq or some other basketball player). \n",
      "That movie is a classic its called SpaceJam they even made an edition of the michael jordan shoes for the movie\n",
      "Hah! I should have known it was MJ in the movie!! It was definitely a different kind of movie than the superhero stuff they mostly make nowadays. Very reminiscent of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. \n",
      "Who framed roger rabbit is one of my favorite childhood films and it had the actor who played the scientist Doc in back o the future. Did you ever see the new wonder woman film?\n",
      "I did see WW, and thought it was really good (though I was mad that they killed off Chris Pine's character).  The superhero movies are definitely taking a darker turn than they did when I was younger. Much, much grittier and darker and more serious. \n",
      "I think it definitely started with movies like spawn and darkman but only recently really started taking off with batman begins and the dark knight\n",
      "Yep. DC versus Marvel; Marvel gets more publicity and produces more movies, but DC has a lot of really good stories too. It's neat that they have more consistent \"worlds\" where one movie flows into another (like Wonder Woman appearing in one of the batman movies). \n",
      "Which do you like better marvel or DC?\n",
      "Hard to say. DC is Superman, which is kind of where it all started in my mind. But Marvel has produced a lot of really, really good stuff. I'm still trying to figure out how they're going to recover from dissolving half their characters in the latest Avengers movie! How about you? \n",
      "I love marvel because I was a big fan of the first 2 spiderman films it went downhill after that for the original series I am also a big fan of Ironman and Hulk\n",
      "Marvel keeps reinventing / rebooting their characters (in movies at least; I don't read the comics). I guess it's a way to keep the stories and characters current. Of course so does DC, they just don't have quite as many movies in any given year. It's kind of interesting when they come out with a new movie and \"new\" characters (that turn out to be familiar if you keep up with the print comics). \n",
      "I did not like suicide squad at all their rendition of the joker was too comedic for me.\n",
      "I actually never saw that one, somehow, but I can believe it. In the TV Batman, the Joker was, well, a joker - but in the first movie (years and years ago) they made him out to be a real psychopath. \n",
      "I loved the 1960s TV batman he was fantastic along with jack Nicholson's rendition\n",
      "Adam West was sooooo campy and funny as Batman!! Nicholson's Joker was the one that really, really brought home how psychopathic the character could be. Heath Ledger's Joker was pretty scary as well. Gotham (TV series) has an interesting take on the universe too. \n",
      "Gotham has done a way better job then suicide squad ever could will smith and harley quinns characters really saved that film\n",
      "What character did Will Smith play? And is it true Harley Quinn was the Joker's daughter? \n",
      "He played Deadshot go watch the film you can see it on Fmovies or Solarmovies google it\n",
      "I'll have to check for it soon; I wanted to see it before, just never had the time.  Got done with a Luke Cage / Jessica Jones / Punisher binge relatively recently because my son was watching them all. Those feel more \"real\" than Gotham etc. but hoo boy are they *dark*!!!\n",
      "Punisher film from 2004 is a masterpiece give it a watch but it takes dark to a whole nother level \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, do you like superheroes?\n",
      "Hmm...well I kind of did as a  kid in the 1960's and 1970's, the Superman and Batman type. I was never into the comic book source of the heros but I did enjoy the cartoons and TV shows based off them.\n",
      "I love them. There is a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes.\n",
      "I read that, it made me laugh at the irony a little bit. I did read about Stan Lee last year when he died and he got a lot of good press. If he wrote 15 DC  Comics series re-imaging superhero's he must have been a pretty creative guy and good writer.\n",
      "That's interesting. I had no idea he also wrote 15 of the DC comics. \n",
      "Yes, and he ended every phone conversation by saying \"Excelsior!\", he sounded like quite a character.\n",
      "That's very funny. He was a good guy for sure. There is a Garfield book series spinoff named Pet Force and it's all of the Garfield characters acting as superheroes.\n",
      "Yes, the genre seems to me to lend itself to that, like the \"NormalMan\" who's the only non-Super Hero on a planet populated by Superhero's. That ironic and kind of funny too, then again they're called comic books!\n",
      "That is ironic. I saw that Marvel takes place in in earth-199999.\n",
      "Yes, that a lot of years in the future. Doesn't the earth's sun, run out of fuel and burn up sometime before then according to astronomers? Do you like Wonder Woman? That movie was the highest-grossing origin movie and wwi movie, sounds like a studio's dream as a money maker.\n",
      "I think it does. I've never seen Wonder Woman. That's pretty amazing it grossed that much.\n",
      "I read that when she first showed up in the comics in 1941 she was originally the Justice Societie's secretary. That a little sexist, but then again in 1941 maybe they didn't think so.\n",
      "That is very sexist. I bet that wouldn't fly in our society today.\n",
      "No it wouldn't and good for society for evolving. Did you know that Gal Gadot, the actress who played Wonderwoman actually thought she was testing for Catwoman, the old female Superhero switcharoo...\n",
      "Wow I did not know that. Did you know Michigan State has the largest public comic book collection in the world?\n",
      "No, that was news to me. I went to Illinois in the Big 10 and I've been to Michigan State, but I was unaware it was the Mecca of Comic Book collections. Did you know that the DC in DC Comics stands for Detective Comics so DC Comics means Detective Comics Comics, redundant indeed. I wonder who thought up that in the first place?\n",
      "I wonder as well. I saw that Marvel once published a generic comic book to trademark the names super-hero and super-villian.\n",
      "Yes, I wonder if the stories in  generic comic book was populated entirely by lawyers as they needed that baseline so the lawyers could trade mark \"Super-hero, -villain\" etc. as super abilities over the average?\n",
      "I wonder that as well. Did you know female superheroes are sometimes called superheroine?\n",
      "I think that Super-heroine is actually more correct grammatically, but a few more letters to pronounce. I also saw that comic books have some origins in 18th Century Japan, becoming popular in the US in the 1930's. I wonder how those original Japanese Comics were marketed in Japan and where they sold them.\n",
      "It was good talking to you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you see the Wonder Woman movie?\n",
      "Yea, I though Patt Jenkins did a great job directing Wonder Woman\n",
      "It was the highest grossing superhero origin movie and also the highest grossing WW1 movie.  I was surprised to find that out.\n",
      "Well Gal Gadot did a great job in the Wonder Woman role, I'm sure that helped\n",
      "Yes. I  had no idea who she was before that.  I was surprised to find out that she served 2 years as a soldier in the Israel defense forces.  So she already had some real life training for the role.\n",
      "Yea, I guess that training was put into great use since the movie takes place during WWI\n",
      "Right!  When she auditioned for Wonder Woman, Gal thought she was testing for Catwoman. lol\n",
      "That's pretty funny. Did you know the inventor of the lie detector tes also created Wonder Woman?\n",
      "I didn't know that!  Do you like to read comic books?  I did when I was a kid.\n",
      "Yea, I loved reading Garfield, it's funny they originally owned the gmail.com domain\n",
      "I didn't know that and yes!  I loved Garfield too.  Michigan State University library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world.  I wonder if people still check them out?\n",
      "Probably. Did you know Marvel comics had to spend 10 years convincing the US government x-men were not human?\n",
      "LOL I didn't know that.  How crazy is that?\n",
      "Pretty crazy. DC also only paid $130 for the rights to superman in 1938, they made out big time\n",
      "Wow.  Yes they did.  I just found out that DC comics stands for Detective Comics.\n",
      "Pretty redundant, but they also invented the term 'brainiac'\n",
      "Nice.  There are over 300 registered superheroes in the USA.\n",
      "Petty crazy, there's suppose to 30 superhero movies released between 2016-2020\n",
      "Wow.  They are making a ton of money off of them.  They will probably keep making them until people stop watching.  There is actually a superhero called Normalman who was the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes.  That's funny.\n",
      "I'm just glad Michael Jackson wasn't able to buy marvel comics to play spiderman\n",
      "He might have changed up the role somehow and would have ruined it.  I had fun chatting!  Have a good one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi. How are you? Do you like movies?\n",
      "Hi! I love movies! I liked the Teen Titans, did you see it?\n",
      "I personally didn't watch this particular movie. What was it about?\n",
      "It is a superhero movie. Do you like superheros?\n",
      "I love superhero movies and I did watch one of my favorite superhero movies and it was Wonder Woman a 2017 movie.\n",
      "I love Wonder Woman too. Did you know Stan Lee almost changed careers? That would have been sad!\n",
      "Yes that would of been. I loved Stan Lee and without him there are no DC comics.\n",
      "Exactly, so sad he passed, but he will live on through this work. He co created Hulk, Iron Man X men, so many that probably would not have been movies if he wasn't around.\n",
      "That is very true. Do you know who produced Wonder Woman?\n",
      "DC Entertainment I believe. Funny that The Smithsonian had a special viewing for only 1 day of Wonder Womans invisible jet....crazy! \n",
      "You're correct it was DC Entertainment along with RatPac Entertainment and a Chinese company Tencent Pictures. Do you know by any chance who directed Wonder Woman?\n",
      "Wasn't it directed by Patty Jenkins? I think it was from a screenplay.\n",
      "Yes it was Patty Jenkins. Thanks. Do you know the actress that was playing Wonder Woman?\n",
      "Gal Gardot? I think anyway, with roles played by Robin Wright, Chris Pine, Danny Huston, and many more what a great cast! I think wonder woman is the best superhero. I remember her from a very long time ago. \n",
      "She was very good at that movie and in fact Wonder Woman was the highest grossing superhero movie.\n",
      "Really? Wow, that is pretty impressive! Her 1st ever feature film was The Lego Movie. \n",
      "Did Gal Gadot served in the military in Israel? \n",
      "I have no idea, lol. Do you like comic books? I had many when I was a kid, what is your favorite?\n",
      "She served in the Israel defense forces. I love comic books and my favorite was the Hulk what was yours?\n",
      "I liked Batman and Spiderman  and pretty much all superhero comic books, big fan! So you have not seen the Teen Titans movie, did you ever see the show on tv? You don't need to have seen the show to enjoy the movie! It is very funny and has a lot to offer and great music too. Do you think there will be anymore Wonder Woman Movies?\n",
      "I have never watched Teen Titans not even on TV but I will watch it at some point based on what you told me. Thanks. I believe that there will be another Wonder Woman after that amazing performance by Gal Gadot.\n",
      "Great! You will really enjoy it! So many people have enjoyed Teen Titans and Wonder Woman, so I think they will have more movies too. One of the best superheros ever.\n",
      "Thank you so much for your input and it was very nice chatting with you!!! Bye\n",
      "Thanks, you too!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello! Are you into comic books and superheroes?\n",
      "I am, do you have a favorite superhero?\n",
      "I would have to say the Punisher, only because he is human and insane lol. How about you?\n",
      "I like Batman, he is also human and has crazy skills, \n",
      "Did you like him in the new DC movies? I thought Wonder Woman was good, not only because it was the highest grossing WW1 movie ever.\n",
      "I didnt, I prefer the Nolan trilogy 1000 times, Wonder woman was good I agree with you, \n",
      "I right there with you! I didn't know gal gadot served in the Israel Defense Forces, but I'm sure it's law there to.\n",
      "She did? wow, I bet she makes the dangerous stunts in the movie herself, its been almost 2 years since the movie came out right?\n",
      "That's right. I can't believe that when she joined the justice league in 1941, the group made her their secretary!\n",
      "Thats funny lol, I bet she would kick their behinds if they made her their secretary now\n",
      "Haha too funny I'm sure she would! Did you know there are over 300 real life superheroes that are registered?\n",
      "over 300 really? a lot of creativity out there, \n",
      "I wonder what their \"superpowers\" are? I should check out Michigan State's library because it has the largest public comic book collection in the world!\n",
      "That is a great place to start, maybe the comic series about fixing collateral damage is available there too\n",
      "I remember hearing about them, that would be a bad job to have haha. I would like to be normalman haha.\n",
      "Who is normalman? Im not aware of that hero lol\n",
      "He is the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes lol.\n",
      "Sounds like he has a hard job lol, his at a disadvantage there, Stan Lee had a lot of imagination I wonder if he created Normalman\n",
      "I agree! Stan lee ended all phone conversations with \"excelsior\". That is too funny!\n",
      "That is funny, so sad he is dead, I heard  he wrote 15 DC comics, I have to find out wich ones\n",
      "Oh really? I'll go look into that right now. Have a great day!\n",

      "Hi,  I like Google,  I dont think I know much about the AI they are creating,  besides their self driving cars. \n",
      "Well, that's not something to worry about. But google is a very big company impacting lots of people's lives.\n",
      "Why wouldnt that be something to worry about?  \n",
      "Well, google went down for about 5 minutes at one point, and it took down 40% of web traffic with it.\n",
      "Oh thats why I shouldnt worry about self driving cars as articial intelligence?  That makes sense lol \n",
      "Also, some AI an mimic and learn human functions. So they might overpower us one day.\n",
      "Kinda sounds like you are just having a conversation with yourself,  thats cool.  Oh really,  very interesting. \n",
      "A robot, programmed by a computer, could also be designed to carry out a conversation like this.\n",
      "Is that a hint??  Are you a robot? Yeah,  I think companies already do that,  have an automated answering service,  pretty weird.  \n",
      "Facebook, is developing an AI to understand emotions and identify stuff, so there's also those kind of AI/ Robots.\n",
      "I hear Google artificial intelligence class uses Google hangouts to teach more efficiently. \n",
      "I believe it Stanford's free artificial intelligence class that uses hangouts to teach more effectively.\n",
      "Kristen stewart co authored a paper about artifical intelligence.\n",
      "I wonder if someone at Google ever read it.\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "Google employees that need help could improve their knowledge by reading it.\n",
      "Did you know robots can be controlled by using rat brains? \n",
      "I heard that it's personality is changed depending on the brain they used.\n",

      "I can't believe google is only 10 years old!\n",
      "They have certainly grown pretty fast. I love YouTube!\n",
      "i do too! i also like google maps. Do you use that a lot?\n",
      "For almost each trip I make when I don't know where it is, especially on out of town trips\n",
      "same, i use it a lot when i'm going to familiar places too in order to see if there is traffic on the road or an accident\n",
      "Whenever Google goes down even for one second, there is usually a big uproar by users\n",
      "i can't say i've ever witness it going down, have you?\n",
      "No, but I did witness YouTube going down recently.\n",
      "that would not be good! I use youtube to create my gym playlist. I now see here on the facts that google did go down on 8/16/2013 for 5 minutes and it took 40% of the web traffic with it. WOW\n",
      "Did you see the Google CEO testify before Congress recently?\n",
      "i did not. why was he testifying? did it have to do with tracking phones? (maybe I did see...)\n",
      "I can't recall but I do remember a Senator embarrassing themself by asking a question about Facebook\n",
      "I think i saw a clip! And he was trying to explain how the internet works to one of the gov't officials and it was almost comical how he (the gov't official) couldn't comprehend lol.\n",
      "And we wonder why the government is shutdown today and why they cant seem to come to an agreement. \n",
      "right?? I think we are on day 20 of it? we sure could use some of these smart tech CEO's in office\n",
      "The Google CEO seemed articulate and impressed me enough that I think he would do well in elected office.\n",
      "i think many of these younger guys would, but they might have a hard time convincing the older generations to vote for them\n",
      "I usually use Google for all of my news content to see how things are going in the government\n",
      "same here. it is interesting that google changes its maps based on the border claims of each country!\n",
      "I wonder how they are dealing with the border security issue on Google? Can you see the border wall on Google maps?\n",
      "i'm not sure! i believe maps are updated every so often, i've never looked at that specific area though\n",

      "It would be cool to have john legend make reservations for me though!\n",
      "It might be, but voice that sounds exactly like a human could be troubling.\n",
      "That is a little scary. Reminds me of black mirror, although I have not seen that...\n",
      "Google has done a lot!   Do you know much about the company?\n",
      "I know they prefer dogs over cat! I also know their stock price!\n",
      "Interesting.    Did you know a google search takes more computing power than NASA had in the sixties!\n",
      "I did not know that. But that does make sense. I did not know they owned youtube either.\n",
      "True.     In 2013, google went down for five minutes and took out 40% of the web traffic!\n",
      "They also use goats to mow their corporate headquarters.\n",

      "Hi, are you ok over there? Ready for a chat? We can talk about the guitar\n",
      "Ok, I love guitars. Guitars are fretted instruments that usually have six strings but there's also 12 string guitars.\n",
      "There are also 7 string guitars when 6 don't do the job. \n",
      "Very funny. Guitars are played with both hands by strumming or plucking the strings with either a pick or the fingers of one hand while simultaneously fretting with the fingers of the other hand. Cool!\n",
      "I seent it! Guitar what have 7 strings. No fibs. They can be plucked with finger, toes, tongues, what have you. Jimmi Hendricks used his teeth.\n",
      "Cool, love that Hendrix music. The sound of the vibrating strings are projected either acoustically or electrically.\n",
      "I would say electrically for the most part. I figure the acoustic part is pretty good but not as sexy.\n",
      "When Eddie Van Halen recorded the guitar solo for \"Beat It\" he literally set the studio speakers on fire.\n",
      "He is a budding pyromaniak. He destroyed perfectly good equipment because of his passion.\n",
      "Speaking of Eddie Van Halen, did you know that he played that solo for Michael as a favor and free of charge?\n",
      "Eddie probably didnt need the money but he probably could have used tix to one of Michaels shows. Or maybe that glove that Michael wore. Plus Eddie set fire to the equipment, so he owed him for that.\n",
      "Michael is pretty wild too. Did you know that Freddie Mercury cancelled a duet with Michael in the 80s because Michael insisted on bringing his llama to the studio? Har-de-har-har!\n",
      "Michael had many friends among animals. I dont know how they communacated but they did. Mike had a sixth sense about these things.\n",
      "Not only animals but Michael wanted to buid a 50 foot robot of himself to roam the Nevada Desert.\n",
      "He would do something like that. Maybe Eddie van halen would set in on fire. LOL.\n",
      "Michael was very cool. His popularity helped to bring the channel MTV to fame. I loved Michael.\n",
      "Michael was a true hero to us humans, and to the llamas. He should be remembered as a 50 feet statue in the dessert.\n",
      "Well he was famous for his robot and moonwalk dance! Michael's distinctive sound and style has influenced many,many artist of various genres.\n",
      "His robot could carry on his tradition in a giant way. Off to the dessert and roaming around moon walking.\n",
      "Michael will NEVER be forgotten.  Did you know that the Bart Simpson hit song 'Do the Bartman' was written by Michael, a massive Simpson fan?\n",
      "Michael has touched so many in so many ways so many times. I truly miss his genius. He was not tall but he cast the shadow of a 50 feet robot.\n",
      "Yes, he WAS that wonderful! Nice chatting with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good morning! Are you a fan of michael jackson music?\n",
      "Yea I'd like MJ's bigger hits like Thriller and Beat It\n",
      "I see that M actually wrote the song to the Simpsons \"Do the Bartman.\"\n",
      "That's pretty cool, I know he did a guest voice too. I never knew he wanted to do a  Harry Potter musical though\n",
      "That's interesting. Freddie Mercury also cancelled a duet with him because he insissted on bringing his llama into the studio\n",
      "MJ was a weird dude, I'm shocked Steven Spielberg wanted him to play Peter Pan in Hook\n",
      "Honestly, that would have been creepy, even back in the early 90s. \n",
      "I agree, Michael hasn't been non-creepy since he recorded Thriller with the band toto\n",
      "Heh. Fair point. He wanted to build a 50 foot robot of himself to wander the nevada desert.. which is interesting.\n",
      "I'd be down if the robot did the moonwalk, even though MJ didn't invent it \n",
      "Would be awesome to watch!\n",
      "Yea, it's quite ironic that Jackson popularized the robot dance and wanted to build a robot lol\n",
      "Could he make it sing too?\n",
      "I don't know, I'm kinda glad his brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon didn't share his vision of making a 50ft robot\n",
      "I'm glad they didnt lol\n",
      "Are you interested in the Piano at all? There was a mute man who could only communicate via piano in England\n",
      "Interested yes, good at it ,no lol\n",
      "It's odd how many people are able to play it, like Richard Nixon who performed a piano concerto on the Tonight Show\n",
      "the BBC decided once they had no news, so they play music instead lol\n",
      "That's pretty cool, so is the piano Mozart and Haydn made from the same tree!\n",
      "apparenly british climbers found a piano on the highet peak?\n",

      "Hello there,do you have a favorite instrument?\n",
      "I do, I like guitar and piano as well. And you?\n",
      "Nice, I like guitar too. Did you know Van Halen once set the speakers on fire while playing the guitar?\n",
      "Wow that is amazing. Do you know who Brian May is?\n",
      "Yes the lead guitarist of the Queen who is also a genius scientist\n",
      "\n",
      "He sure is, with a degree in astrophysics and a PhD at that, that is impressive\n",
      "It sure is. Do you know who Matthew Bellamy from Muse is?\n",
      "Yeah the guy holds the record for the most guitars smashed while on tour\n",
      "That is insane and a lot of money there too. Brian from Queen uses coins instead of picks \n",
      "I wonder if those work better. How about the piano?\n",
      "Love the piano too. Once the BBC only played piano as they did not have newsworthy news\n",
      "I like that actually. Mercury and McCartney used the same piano for their songs once\n",
      "I think  I heard of that, Bohemian Rhapsody and Hey Jude right?\n",
      "Yeah exactly. Have you heat of a song called circus gallop?\n",
      "I think that is the song they use to stress test piano and cannot be played by humans\n",
      "That is so cool. There is a piano that was found on the highest mountain in Britain\n",
      "Wow wonder who put it up there. Do you like Michael Jackson?\n",
      "I do actually he has some amazing music. He was once supposed to do a duet with Freddy Mercury but that did not go through\n",
      "Yeah if only Michael had not insisted on bringing his llama to the studio\n",
      "Yeah and we could have had a great hit for sure. He helped write the soundtrack for Sonic 3 though\n",
      "That is pretty cool. And he also built a robot of himself to roam in Nevada desert\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "Hello there, I am good thank you.  How are you today?\n",
      "Very well, thanks. Do you know a lot about Google/\n",
      "I don't know too much, I would say average.  I know that they are a huge company that is involved in much more than people would think. \n",
      "Well...A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send neil armstrong and eleven other astronauts to the moon\n",
      "Holy cow! That is crazy to think about.  I guess they use Android devices to calculate traffic by seeing how fast they are moving down the road. \n",
      "Instead of hiring people to mow the lawns around their headquarters, google once used hundreds of live goats.\n",
      "What?! That is so cool, I wonder what happened to all the goats. \n",
      "They were transported to a farm nearby tomake goat cheese and milk.\n",
      "That is awesome.  How do you feel about AI?\n",
      "I love it. Do you know some facts about it?\n",
      "I don't know too much.  I do think that IBM's Watson is very useful when it comes to the medical field. \n",
      "It is! On 16th august 2013 google went down for about five minutes, and took 40% of web traffic with it.\n",
      "That is so much, I wonder how much it would take down if that happened today?\n",
      "Probably 60-65%. What's your guess?\n",
      "Yeah I would say you are right, maybe even more than that.  Google's stock price is very high as well. \n",
      "I know. I should have bought in at $400... When there is a disputed border, google maps tailors its maps to the claims of each country where the internet browser is located\n",
      "Yeah that, and some Facebook, and the biggest one would have been buying Amazon. \n",
      "I tried to buy in to Amazon at $700. It's now at $1800. At least I bought into GE at $60... it's at $8...\n",
      "Lol, yeah I actually bought some GE last year and it's gone nothing but down, and then down again.  What do you think stocks will finish this next year, up or down?\n",
      "Down. I see it as stocks on sale. Im going to put in 3 times what I normally do. I want so cheap stock.\n",
      "I agree, I have been hoarding some cash waiting to add to my ROTH.  Well it was nice chatting with you today, I always like talking someone who is up to date on stocks and finance. Have a nice day. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi there, do you play any instruments?\n",
      "Hi there, yes I do, I play the guitar and you?\n",
      "I do not play it but I like the sound of it. Van Halen once set the speakers on fire by playing the guitar\n",
      "Heard about that by playing the beat it song, was doing the solo\n",
      "THat is so amazing. DO you know Brian May from Queen?\n",
      "Yeah he is a scientist on top of a musician, an astrophysicist to be more exact\n",
      "Yeah pretty cool. ANd he uses a coin to play his guitar with\n",
      "Yeah that is quite interesting. Pink Floyd have a recording studio that is in a grand houseboat\n",
      "That is amazing. How about the piano?\n",
      "I love the piano, it is a classical instrument, and you?\n",
      "Yeah and BBC must have liked it so much that they once played an instrumental of piano instead of giving the news. \n",
      "That is amazing for a channel like them. have you heard of the circus gallop?\n",
      "I heard that is cannot be played by humans and it is used to stress test the pianos\n",
      "yeah that is it. There is a piano on top of the highest mountain in UK\n",
      "Yeah that was found by the climbers but I wonder who out it there\n",
      "Yeah I wonder too about that. Do you like Michael Jackson?\n",
      "I like his music yes Did you know him and Freddie Mercury were supposed to do a duet?\n",
      "Yeah but he Jackson insisted on bringing his Llama to the studio and Jackson refused\n",
      "Wow we could have had an amazing song out now. He helped with the soundtrack for Sonic 3 too\n",
      "Wow he was everywhere. And he built a robot of himself to roam around Nevada desert\n",
      "Wow I wonder if that ever took flight. Nice chat\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, do you have any pets? In Japan there are more pets then kids under 15 years old.\n",
      "I used to take care of pit bulls but now I just have a cat. Do you?\n",
      "Neat. I have 4 cats so I guess you can say I am ailurophile. That's what people who love cats are called, but it's not too common to hear.\n",
      "I've never heard that. Ya I downsized but I used to own a house so I could adopt dogs that people weren't allowed to have in apartments\n",
      "I see. People who love dogs are known as cynophiles but you probably haven't heard that either. Another interesting fact though.\n",
      "No, I haven't heard that. ha ha I can see why people might want a pet instead of kids\n",
      "Small pocket pets are way easier to take care of at least, and cheaper too.\n",
      "oh ya like rodents?\n",
      "Yeah, I have had hamsters and once I kept a rat. The pet ones are much nicer then what most people think of as rats.\n",
      "oh ya. My cat brought me a flying squirrel a few weeks ago but she didn't kill it. \n",
      "Wow. I've only seen a flying squirrel once before. Exotic pets are cool too. Did you know there are more pet tigers in the us alone then all wild ones in asia?\n",
      "I didn't know that. I had never seen a flying squirrel. If I did I don't remember. My daughter works for  a vet and she said it's a flying squirrel\n",
      "Interesting. They aren't something you see every day. Much like my pet lizard. He hides a lot so I only see him every few days in his huge cage.\n",
      "oh cool, ya, I worked with a guy who had a  pet turtle\n",
      "Turtles live forever. I had them as pets too but gave them away when I moved. I love talking about pets. \n",
      "ya, I miss my dogs. My vet knows someone who has a farm so she adopted my dog\n",
      "Maybe it's time to adopt a new dog? Or you could always get a parrot?\n",
      "ya, my dog and cat were friends. Dogs aren't allowed to where I live now. Probably one cat is enough for now\n",
      "Well there is always the future. Speaking of the future, soon I'm going to go watch Harry Potter. The movies are better then the books.\n",
      "Oh really? I used to read the Lion, Witch, and Wardrobe. The movie was not as good as the book. \n",
      "Usually that's the case but I just like the movies better. Maybe because they were translated from british english to american even though its the same language.\n",
      "oh yeah, like here it's called a cart and there it is called a buggy or something like that\n",
      "anyways time to watch the movie. Bye for now.\n",
      "ok good to chat\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you have a pet?\n",
      "I sure do! I have a dog, even though the most popular pet is the cat.\n",
      "Wow, I would have figured a dog, I heard the first cloned pet was a cat\n",
      "I would have too! I never knew they cloned a cat. In Hawaii it is illegal to own a hamster. So odd.\n",
      "That is very odd. I will clone my dog KOKO when she dies, she is my everything.\n",
      "Awww. So sweet. Do you know why people with pets are at a greater risk during a natural disaster?\n",
      "I bet, they always tend to go back for them. I would go back for sure! Did you hear about the law in colorado about pets?\n",
      "You are somewhat right. The risk is pets make them less likely to evacuate. I do not know CO law. What is it?\n",
      "It is not legal to own a pet, but you can be their guardian, kind of funny\n",
      "Oh that is strange. Do you know what kind of species keeps pets?\n",
      "I never knew there was a species that did, which is it?\n",
      "There is a species of tarantula that uses frogs to keep ants away from their eggs.\n",
      "lol that is awesome and so smart! Did you hear there are more tigers in the US than in the wild\n",
      "I can believe that. I wonder if most are kept as pets? I know people keep pets because they have relatable personalities.\n",
      "So interesting. Were you a harry potter fan?\n",
      "A little. I've been to Universal. J.K. Rowling is the HP author.\n",
      "I loved those rides! Harry Potter was born in 1980\n",
      "Oh, okay. I think the main idea is the struggle between Potter and Lord Voldemort.\n",
      "Yea what a crazy battle to watch. It was so nice chatting with you!\n",
      "Yes, pretty odd. Rowling also wrote an alternative HP ending! I did not know.\n",
      "Wow, I wonder if she ever released it, I would love to see that. enjoy your weekend!\n",

      "How's it going, do you like jazz, it originated in the 1800s\n",
      "I love jazz music, I studied it in school a couple years like Tupac did! How about you\n",
      "I like Jazz too, especially the Cool jazz that was developed in the 1940s\n",
      "Nice, I need to hear some of that right now. That sounds so good. Actually Louie armstrong beat out the beatles top spot in 1964.\n",
      "That's pretty crazy but Jazz is pretty popular, theres even a chart toping jazz orchestra in Pakistan\n",
      "I would love to hear that and the style they use! Do you think Abe Lincoln liked jazz?\n",
      "I don't know, he did have a high pitch voice\n",
      "So he would have liked other music, I never knew that. I know he was in the wrestling hall of fame, that is a good honor\n",
      "Nice. Apparently Lincoln created the secret service the morning he was shot, I guess he should of created the day before\n",
      "Wow, that is a little eerie. Lincoln had a bartenders license, but that would not have helped him much\n",
      "Lincoln also kept important documents inside his hat too\n",
      "That was a large hat, I am sure he kept a lot of stuff in there lol. I wonder if his birth certifcate was there, he shares a birthday with charles darwin\n",
      "That's pretty cool. Did you know John Wilkes' Booth's father was named after Ceasar's assassin?\n",
      "wow, more eerie also! Almost as eerie as Lincoln doing the gettysburg address while suffering from smallpox. That is like michael jordan and his flu game lol\n",
      "I never knew that. Lincoln was also the first president with a beard\n",
      "And a sweet beard for sure! Do you think Abe had a favorite shirt?\n",
      "Probably a button up or button down shirt\n",
      "lol I agree. I wonder what they wore at his funeral. At billy mays funeral they wore blue shirts and khaki pants\n",
      "I wouldn't want to be a pallbearer at Billy Mays funeral\n",
      "right, just terrible colors to wear and especially for a funeral. At least it isn't the plain shirts like zuckerburg wears that cost like 300 dollars\n",
      "Well I have to go, nice chatting with you\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "DO you have a favorite type of shirt?\n",
      "I like them all actually. In China they use to wear many of them and pop the collars during the cultural revolution\n",
      "yeah I guess that was one way to get distinguished\n",
      "I guess. Do you know how the polos were invented?\n",
      "Yes they were invented by a tennis player Rene Lacoste\n",
      "Yes and then was adopted by others and the rest is history\n",
      "Yeah. DO you know what button down refers to?\n",
      "Yes when the collar tips are fastened to the shirt\n",
      "Yes and how about the button up?\n",
      "It is when they are not fastened to the shirt\n",
      "Yeah. Do you know what is the official attire in Hawaii?\n",
      "Yes the aloha shirt. Do you like jazz?\n",
      "I sure do and so does CLint Eastwood, he is a lifelong enthusiast\n",
      "Yeah. A woman in Harlem hosts jazz concerts everyday in her home\n",
      "Yes and has been doing that for over 20 years now\n",
      "Yeah and some really popular jazz people have stopped by too\n",
      "Yeah. Do you know which country has one of the best jazz orchestras?\n",
      "Yes that would be Pakistan, they are always topping the charts\n",
      "Yeah. Do you know why the trumpeters grow goatees?\n",
      "Because it is more comfortable to play the trumpets for them\n",
      "Yes they have figure a good and easy way I guess\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "good morning\n",
      "Hello. Are you a fan of jazz?\n",
      "I like to listen to it live\n",
      "Neat! Jazz originated in New Orleans. \n",
      "How about you? Do you listen to jazz?\n",
      "Once in a while. I didn't realize it was referred to as \"America's classical music\".\n",
      "Me either, I also didnt realize there were so many different types of Jazz\n",
      "Yes! Since the 1920s Jazz Age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. \n",
      "So any plans for christmas?\n",
      "Just giving gifts to family. I got my brother some new shirts. I can't believe the plain grey shirt mark zuckerburg wears all the time costs between $300 and $400\n",
      "I dont care how much money I have, I dont think I would ever pay that much for a t-shirt\n",
      "No way! The tee shirt was invented in 1904 for bachelors who couldn't sew or replace buttons. \n",
      "I wish I could just wear a tee shirt for work but I have to wear button down shirts.  What about you?\n",
      "I have to dress up, also. In British English, a shirt is collared and cuffed, and has buttons or snaps while in American English, a shirt refers to many types of upper body garments. \n",
      "I wish I lived in Hawaii where I could wear an aloha shirt instead of a suit and tie.\n",
      "That would be nice! Shirts used to just be a men's undergarment. Fashion has really changed over time!\n",
      "It really has.  Think of how Abraham Lincoln dressed.  He was always in a suit.  I guess a Lawyer and politician needs to\n",
      "Things were definitely different in the 1800's when he was around!\n",
      "Did you know that John Wilkes Booth was named after the guys that assassinated Julius Caesar?  \n",
      "That is creepy! I didn't realize that Darwin & Lincoln shared a birthday\n",
      "crazy stuff.  Have a great day \n",
      "Nice chatting with you. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a big fan of watching films?\n",
      "Yes, I am. Currently, I don't have a lot of time, but in my student time I watched a lot. How about you?\n",
      "I am a big fan of comedy and action films like pineapple express and tropic thunder. I have kids so i also watch alot of kids films have you ever heard of the movie ' A Wrinkle In Time'?\n",
      "Is it the last year movie? I've seen a trailer. Changing a topic, did you know that Disney used a special multiplane camera to make their older films like Bambi more realistic?\n",
      "Thats amazing, do you know which city Walt Disney Studies is based in?\n",
      "Yes, I know. I've been in this city in Cali about 5 years ago, but I didn't know before. \n",
      "Yes in burbank where there is a famous airport. Do you know which is the first Disney animated film directed by a woman?\n",
      "No, I didn't know. I was also surprised that the term \"scientist\" came into regular use in the 19th century.\n",
      "The film is Frozen. Do you know who the emperor of japan who is still currently a scientist?\n",
      "No, I don't. It amazing. \n",
      "His name is Akihito. Do you happen to know who coined the term scientist?\n",
      "I believe it was William Whewell. However, this is the first time I've heard about him.\n",
      "Have you ever heard of who the first scientist to walk on the moon was?\n",
      "No, I have no idea. I also didn't know that Walt Dusney won academy award for animation classic snow in 1937\n",
      "Walt Disney is a superpower when it comes to the film & animation industry\n",
      "Yes, they amazing things. For example, it took over 9 million party balloons to lift Carl's house, in the movie \"Up\"\n",
      "I love up The grumpy old man is my favorite character what is your favorite Disney movie?\n",
      "The Lion King. I know it's too child, but it's fantastic. \n",
      "No I completely agree the lion king is an absolute classic simba is the classic journey of every young man.\n",
      "Well, we know there are a lot of amazing facts about Dysney. It's number 1 in the world.\n",
      "Yes they basically made my whole childhood \n",
      "True. It was my pleasure to talk with you.\n",
      "Have a good day my friend watch a disney film for me today\n",
      "Sure. \n",
      "Bye :D\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I had no idea a new movie about \"A Wrinkle in Time\" was coming out!\n",
      "I didn't either, how awesome! It should be really good!\n",
      "Right? Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling???!!! What a movie!\n",
      "That's an all star cast I can't wait! \n",
      "Well, At a recent screening, the filmmaker herself seemed eager to manage expectations. In a taped prologue, DuVernay urged filmgoers to watch the movie while in touch with their \"inner child,\" a useful piece of advice for a movie that turns out to be a kids' film, for better and for worse.\n",
      "I love Walt Disney Pictures, so exciting. The book came out so long ago this will be a treat!\n",
      "I know, Disney is the best. \"the lion king\" was the first disney film to be dubbed into zulu for its african release.\n",
      "Really? Wow that's interesting. In 1937 Snow white earned Disney an academy award!\n",
      "Seriously? Wow, is that the first Academy for a cartoon?\n",
      "I have no idea but it's amazing. I like some animated films better than than the real films sometimes. Have you seen Black Panther?\n",
      "I have. I have also seen Frozen. Frozen was the first animated disney film directed by a woman.\n",
      "Wow, that's awesome! Frozen is the best! \n",
      "I know. Disney is great, in general... During the 70s, disney recycled a lot of their animation frames, resulting in identical scenes in some movies\n",
      "Oh I did not know that! Did you know The four vultures in disney's the jungle book were both designed after and originally supposed to be voiced by the beatles.\n",
      "I did not, just like I did not know the toy industry gets involved in disney animations even before the beginning of the film production.\n",
      "Really? How cool is that. Very interesting! \n",
      "I know. I learn so much here. The richest superhero is actually black panther, who has an estimated of $500 billion, whereas tony stark is worth $100 billion and bruce wayne $80 billion\n",
      "WoW, That's a lot of money. I love Marvel movies.\n",
      "Me too. The emperor of Japan  is a scientist and still publishes papers to this day. I think he will catch up to the black panther shortly.\n",
      "True! I really like the director of Black Panther, Ryan Coogler he did an amazing job!\n",
      "He did a great job. I was impressed with the shoots all movie long. The symbols and written script featured in black panther are based on an actual script called nsibdi, dating back as far as the 4th century and indigenous to present-day nigeria\n",
      "Really? That's interesting! I didn't know that. Did you know Chadwick Boseman couldn't afford the summer theater program at Oxford and Denzel Washington funded his tuition!\n",
      "What!?!?! I did not know that. What a great tidbit...\n",
      "It is! I love the little facts we never hear about.\n",
      "OK so did you know the development of the disney animated film wreck-it-ralph started in the late 1980's, spanning nearly three decades and four working titles.\n",
      "Whoa, that's awesome! \n",
      "Right? Marvel censored m'baku's utterance of \"praise hanuman!\" in indian releases of black panther, fearing that showing a seemingly villainous character praising a hindu god would lead to backlash. indians reacted highly negatively as they found that empowering rather than insulting.\n",
      "Very interesting! \n",
      "Did you know Harrison schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon.\n",
      "No!? that is amazing! Did you know it is illegal in Queensland to own a rabbit unless you are a scientist or a magician?\n",
      "I did not know that. Where is queensland?\n",
      "Australia\n",
      "The 7th continent? Down under\n",
      "the second-largest and third-most populous state in the Commonwealth of Australia\n",
      "Really???? Wow, I did not know that. Thanks for sharing\n",
      "No problem!  it is bordered by the Northern Territory, South Australia and New South Wales to the west, south-west and south respectively.\n",
      "Crazy! Speaking of crazy... The development of the disney animated film wreck-it-ralph started in the late 1980's, spanning nearly three decades and four working titles. WRECK IT RALPH!!!!!\n",
      "Wow! That is crazy! \n",
      "Thanks for talking with me. I appreciate your time and attention.\n",
      "You too!!!!\n",
      "This is awkward as we wait for the chat to end...\n",
      "hahahaaa\n",
      "Yeah.... So where do you live...\n",
      "I live in the desert  Az ....how about you?\n",
      "Chicago suburbs. It sounds warm where you are...\n",
      "Yep, love it here! Winter is the best and I am from southeast Iowa originally\n",
      "So there is a difference in weather! I wish I was somewehre warm, although this has been a mild winter.\\\n",
      "Good deal, I don't like the cold very much lol...I think we are done, have a great one!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you a Walt Disney fan?\n",
      "Not really as such, but I like some of the Disney creations despite their corporate culture. How about you?\n",
      "I used to when my kids were little.  I got enjoyment out of seeing them enjoy the movies.  They loved the Lion King which was the first Disney film to be dubbed into Zulu for it's release in South Africa.\n",
      "I remember being excited when the trailers for A Wrinkle in Time came out, and then forgot all about it. I've got to see that! Have you seen it?\n",
      "I've haven't seen that one.  During the 70's Disney recycled a lot of their animation frames resulting in identical scenes in some movies.  Interesting.\n",
      "I think the 70s were the big period of reusable cells, weren't they?\n",
      "Yes.  I believe you are right.  Frozen was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman!\n",
      "I've never seen that one. Have you seen Black Panther? I'm trying to get better about actually watching movies that I want to see when they're advertised.\n",
      "I'm actually getting ready to watch it soon.  Do you have Netflix?  It's now on there for free.  It was produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Disney as well.\n",
      "Really? I should check out what the cost of a Netflix subscription costs.\n",
      "It's fairly cheap.  You can share it with other people as well.  We have Amazon Prime, but also share a Netflix account with our older kids.  If you can spread it out like between family members, you could really have it for only a few dollars per month.  Then you could watch the Black Panther!  Did you know the characters name was briefly changed to \"Black Leopard\"?\n",
      "I didn't know that. Definitely want to see it though. Thanks for the info on Netflix. I'll see which is the best deal, it or Amazon Prime.\n",
      "Netflix would be cheaper probably for month to month.  Amazon prime is $120 for a year but you can also get it monthly.  Not sure of that price though.  You also get the free 2 day shipping as well in addition to the video movies and shows.  Do you know much about scientists?  \n",
      "Just the dumbed-down science coverage in the pop science journals I'm afraid, although it's something I'm very curious about. Do you?\n",
      "Haha me too.  I was reading a little about some today.  Akihito the emperor of Japan is a scientist and still publishes papers to this day!\n",
      "I'll bet he viewed having to take the throne as a sacrifice that kept him from doing what he loved.\n",
      "I wonder.  I'm going to google him when we're done.  Harrison Schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon.  Interesting.  Think they would have had more than one go there.\n",
      "I just assumed the astronauts were all career fighter pilots before the Space Shuttle opened things up to a wider variety of people.\n",
      "Yes it did.  I'm kind of bummed that it doesn't make flights any longer.  Did you know that the world wide web was invented in 1989 by an English scientist workin in Switzerland?  Wow did the internet come on faster than I thought.\n",
      "Really? I assume that was Berners-Lee, but I didn't know his location.\n",
      "I didn't know who it was before today.  lol  It was nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Its sad how that 12 year old had part of his brain removed.\n",
      "I've heard that people can recover. Some brain functionality can shift to new parts of the brain.\n",
      "The kid says he feels normal but getting rid of a part of the brain surely must have further consequences.\n",
      "Tanner is getting therapy to help him develop. He can't play certain sports, but other than that, he might have a pretty normal life.\n",
      "I heard his case was published in the scientific yournal Cell Reports, it might be interesting to look it up and learn more about Tanner.\n",
      "It's certainly an interesting case. Do you play board games like chess?\n",
      "I like to play but Im not good at it what about you?\n",
      "I'm not really into chess. It's a complex game. For example, there are more possible moves in chess than atoms in the universe. \n",
      "I guess thats why the president of the world chess ferderation believes chess was invented by aliens.\n",
      "I wonder who those aliens are. The ones that are using Area 51 as an AirBNB? The negative correlation between IQ and chess says something about the mind and intelligence.\n",
      "I wouldnt know about that, and I did hear there is a correlation, being a good chess player must require a big intellect.\n",
      "It's funny that there's a negative correlation. Probably IQ tests measure different ability. One grandmaster beat a friend at age 5 and didn't even look at the board.\n",
      "He had chess in his blood for sure lol although the official story is that it was created in India and later improved by the Persians.\n",
      "Are you a tennis fan? \n",
      "I love tennis and also love to wear polo shirts,they are really comfortable to wear.\n",
      "The shirts originally designed for tennis players? Funny that the inventor called them polo shirts! And why the crocodile?\n",
      "Maybe thats why Lacoste has a crocodile as brand logo, you know back in 1968 a black man won a US Open Tennis tittle, I cant recall any black champions since.\n",
      "I guess that must have been Arthur Ashe. I can't recall any others either. It's funny that they used a helicopter to dry the grass in 1969. That's a rich man's solution to a problem! LOL\n",
      "Thats funny and also really weird lol, tennis can be really boring if a match extends I wonder how the players keep up.\n",
      "The prize money probably helps focus the mind. A match that lasts 11 hours and takes place over three days is a bit much, though.\n",
      "I know, even for the audience, like get it over already lol\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you hear about the boy who had part of his brain removed due to a tumor?\n",
      "No, I have not heard about that! How old was he?\n",
      "Only twelve, and apart from a few problems with his vision, he's fairly normal. He still does therapy and avoids contact sports, but he's fairly active\n",
      "At least the operation worked out for him. I could not imagine having any of my brain removed. \n",
      "It would be hard, and it took months for him to recover, but he can still do things like playing volleyball and tennis, so that's fairly impressive and shows how advanced the medical field has gotten\n",
      "That is really impressive. It is amazing that we are capable of doing things like this at all.\n",
      "I know! Another amazing feat are the ones who played in the longest tennis match in history. Even though it spread over 3 days, 11 hours is a long time for one match\n",
      "11 hours?? I would have purposefully missed the ball LOL\n",
      "It may have been an important match. The US Open is important enough that in 1969, they used a helicopter to dry the grass court\n",
      "I forgot that there are actual important matches in Tennis. It is not a sport I watch. I wonder who was playing that US Open match in 1969.\n",
      "I'm not sure since it's not a sport I pay much attention to either. The only black man to win first place in the US Open won in 1968. I wonder if he was an inspiration to the Williams sisters\n",
      "I am sure he must have been. I think I read that their father had them train every single day. I wonder if he knew about this man.\n",
      "He likely does. I wonder if they had a natural talent for the game like Gael Monfils did. Just days after learning how to play, he beat the \"Roger Federer of paddle tennis\"\n",
      "I wondered the same thing. It seems odd that two sisters would both excel as much as they do in any one activity. What is paddle tennis? Ping-pong? \n",
      "I believe so. Another name for it is table tennis. I think playing at that level would take the same level of concentration as it does to play a game of chess, though I don't really play either\n",
      "I had no idea that it was ever called table tennis. Oh it definitely has to take some serious concentration. The amount of adrenaline they probably feel playing a game.\n",
      "There was a five year old who beat a family friend at chess without looking at the board. That has to be a case of natural talent\n",
      "Natural talent and really good memorization skills or something. I would have loved to watch that happen.\n",
      "I'm sure the kid had a lot of fun winning that. The game can be traced back to into during the Gupta Empire, yet the President of the World Chess Federation has a theory that it was invented by aliens\n",
      "He has a feeling that the game of chess was invented by aliens.\n",
      "So the aliens came back during that empire? Or did they arrive during the Persian empire when the game was improved. Maybe we'll never know\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you heard about the 12 year old who had a 6th of his brain removed?\n",
      "I have actually. That's pretty crazy. He said he feels like a \"perfectly normal 12-year-old-boy.\"\n",
      "The surgery was 6 years ago, so he has adapted a bit.  But that is so great that he feels normal and doesnt have many problems.\n",
      "Yeah, we've come so far in the past few decades with medical technology. It's absolutely amazing!\n",
      "It really is, and even our bodies are able to adapt.  I had my sciatic nerve removed due to cancer, and should not have any hamstring function, but my body has regained a little.\n",
      "That's awesome! I think that little boy has some issues too, like a few blind spots, but the human body is an amazing machine that can adapt to almost anything!\n",
      "Yeah, the left side of his brain stepped up and took over the function.\n",
      "It's really interesting. So with your sciatic nerve removed, have you lost a lot of motor function?\n",
      "Yeah, I cant feel my foot at all or move it.  I have some feeling on the inner part but nothing else.  Same goes for the calf.\n",
      "That's really cool that you seem to be in good spirits about it, much like the little boy. I guess an event like that can really change your overall perspective.\n",
      "It really does.  I figure getting mad about it doesnt change anything.\n",
      "That's true, I mean, we are all just kind of a spec in the universe, and it's important to use our time wisely while we have it.\n",
      "Very true.  I was listening to a few podcasts about the universe today too.  \n",
      "Really? Which ones? And what's some cool stuff you learned about from them?\n",
      "It is the End of the World as you know it podcast.  It started talking about if we are alone in the universe.\n",
      "Yeah, I've heard of that Podcast. That's awesome! I think some scientist believe that there is a \"cold spot\" in the universe that may lead to a parallel universe. It's really hard to wrap my head around!\n",
      "It is. Part of it was talking about what if there is life meant to be there but hasnt evolved like we have.  Really blows my mind\n",
      "Yeah, it's a super existential feeling, like the theory that our entire universe may just be inside a black hole. It reminds me of the movie Interstellar.\n",
      "I didnt see that one, was it good?\n",
      "It's really good. And the science in the movie was confirmed by a bunch of high-level scientists and physicists. I'm pretty sure their rendering of the  blackhole scene is even used to study blackholes in real life.\n",
      "Wow.  Ill have to check it out.  The creation of the universe and possibility of life outside of our solar system or galaxy is intriguing.\n",
      "Oh yeah, it really puts life into perspective.\n",
      "It does, it makes me wonder if there is a sort of superior life that doesnt deem us as intelligent life as we look at bacteria or something else.\n",
      "Alright, well it was wonderful talking to you. I'm def gonna check out that podcast now. Thanks again!\n",
      "Have a great night!  It was a great chat!\n",

      "Do you like to play chess?\n",
      "well I used to play actually, I'ts pretty fun what about you?\n",
      "Yeah... Did you know that there are more possible moves in Chess than there are atoms in the entire universe?\n",
      "no I didn't, I do know that I read a book by Juit Polgar, she apparently beat a family friend at chess when she was only 5 which is impressive\n",
      "That is crazy!  I couldn't even imagine doing that!  I am definitely not that good!  LOL\n",
      "haha not at all, also weird is there is a negative correlation between iq and chess skill, meaning that high intelligence isn't necessary for good chess playing apparently\n",
      "Oh yeah... i can understand why.  A lot of higher intelegence doesn't have the intuition for strategy like you have to have in chess.\n",
      "it is interesting that chess was invented in India, then later the persians improved on that base, that's a long time ago\n",
      "That is a long time ago!\n",
      "have you heard the theory that the whole universe is only a hologram?\n",
      "No i haven't? How do they figure that?\n",
      "well they say this whole universe is like Virtual Reality, kind of like the Matrix where we are all plugged in, Elon Musk believes that apparently\n",
      "Oh yeah?  Elon Musk is quite the eccentric visionary, that's for sure!\n",
      "ya he has his own way about him for sure, there is another theory how the universe is a single electron but I don't know how that works haha\n",
      "OH WOW!  Those are some far fetched theories!!!  I just saw that there are stars that are cold enough for us to touch.  Wonder how that works?\n",
      "ha thats another one I don't understand! do you play or watch tennis? That is one sport I do play and will occasionally watch\n",
      "Well... i haven't played in a VERY long time.  And i haven't watched since agassi retired.\n",
      "ya I liked agassi, can't imagine a 3 day tennis match, that was the longest match and it lasted 11 hours thats so exhausting\n",
      "Dangggggg... yeah.... that's a bit much!  LOL\n",
      "also a bit much is using a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts, seems crazy too haha\n",
      "OMg... yeah i saw that one!  That's one expensive way to do that for sure!\n",
      "also crazy is no black man has won the us open since 1968, I wonder why that is\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "do you know much about the universe?\n",
      "Some stuff. There is a theory that it was formed through evolution\n",
      "Yeah and another one that there is only one electron in it\n",
      "Yet another one that it is just a giant hologram\n",
      "\n",
      "There are stars that are cold enough for us to touch them\n",
      "THat is so cool. DO you like chess?\n",
      "Somewhat. THere are tons of moves in the game though\n",
      "yes more positive moves than atoms in the universe\n",
      "Yeah pretty impressive.Do you know who the president of the federation thinks invented the game?\n",
      "Yes he thinks it was the aliens\n",
      "Yeah and the game was in reality invented in India\n",
      "Yes during the Gupta Empire and the the persians refined it\n",
      "Yeah, there is a negative correlation between IQ and chess\n",
      "Yeah I always thought it was the opposite of that\n",
      "Yeah me too. Do you know who Judit Polgar is?\n",
      "Yes he is a chess master and he beat someone at the age of 5 \n",
      "He is a genius, you have to be pretty good at it for that age\n",
      "I know. Do you like tennis?\n",
      "I do, do you know how the sport relates to polo shirts?\n",
      "Yes, they were invented by a tennis player, Rene Lacoste\n",
      "Yeah and then adopted by the others\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, do you like literature?\n",
      "Somewhat.   I know that the FDA burned 6 tons of it in an act of censorship.\n",
      "That's pretty crazy. I saw there is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel.\n",
      "I don't know if that would be tough or easy to do? lol\n",
      "I think that would be tough to do honestly. In 1953, Winston Churchill won a nobel prize for literature.\n",
      "Wow.  I never knew that.  Romantic kissing is a fairly recent development in literature.\n",
      "I did not know that either. What is romantic kissing?\n",
      "When 2 people come together to kiss passionately in a loving way?  lol\n",
      "Ahh lol. Architecture, Literature, Music, Painting, and Sculpture were all Olympic events from 1912-1952.\n",
      "I wonder how that worked out for the judging?  Had to have been tough.  Do you like poetry?\n",
      "I like poetry. What about you?\n",
      "I do.  But, don't have much time to read it.  Edgar Allan Poe only received $9 for the publication of \"The Raven\".  Wow.\n",
      "That's crazy. I would have never imagined that.\n",
      "I know right?  Demetri Martin wrote a 224 word palindrome poem.  That sounds like a pretty impressive feat!\n",
      "That sounds hard to do. Almost all of the Hobbit's character names were taken out of an old Icelandic poem.\n",
      "That's pretty neat.  Always wondered where they got those names from.  I would be curious to read the poem that when read normally is depressing, but if you read it backwards it's inspiring.\n",
      "Yea it's pretty cool. Do you like cats?\n",
      "I like cats. I have 2 outside cats.  They have cat cafes in Japan where people pay an hourly rate to play with cats and have drinks!\n",
      "I like cats, but I like dogs a little better. That's hilarious you can pay to drink with cats.\n",
      "Anything to make a dollar!  There is a place in Alaska called Talkeetna where they have a cat named Stubbs as their mayor.  Must be for publicity purposes.  lol\n",
      "Good talking to you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you enjoy reading? I kind of do. There is something intriguing about it. There has also been a lot of important information written down. No wonder the FDA burned over six tons of literature!\n",
      "I love to read, but would never want to read something that won the literature contest for worst opening sentence!\n",
      "Haha yeah that is a good point. what about poetry? I am not a huge fan but there is something special about its long history dating back to prehistorical times with hunting poetry in Africa.\n",
      "I don't love poetry, but do enjoy some of Churchill's work. I'm surprised his nobel price wasn't for literature\n",
      "Oh yeah Churchill is classic for sure. I know I think he deserves to win-he is a definitely a household name. Another classic poet is Edgar Allan Poe-once he only recieved $9 for his poem the raven-now it's a classic!\n",
      "That's a great poem! I'm curious to read Demetri Martin's 224 word palindrome poem. It sounds interesting!\n",
      "Oh yes I have never heard of Martin. Palindrome poems are interesting though I would give it a read as well. I went to Indonesia once. Did you know the Javanese alphabet when recited in order, forms a poem? I would like to hear that.\n",
      "That's very cool! I would also love to read the poem that is depressing, but inspiring when read backwards. That takes talent to write!\n",
      "Yes very good point! Do you have any cats. I feel like lots of poets have cats. In Japan you can pay an hourly rate to play with cats and have drinks!\n",
      "I don't. I don't really like cats! The physicist who coauthored with his cat to use first person plural made me laugh.\n",
      "Yea I am more of a dog person. Haha yeah I would agree with you. All they do is sleep. At the age of 15 , a cat will have spent 10 of those years sleeping. So boring!!\n",
      "How do cats always have good things happen to them though? I mean the stray cat found on set that was then in the Godfather is probably living the good life.\n",
      "Yes I bet he is. Must be that whole 9 lives business. They can just relive until they get good fortune. Also quite surprising there are 70 cat breeds, seems like a lot to me.\n",
      "Yes and how does a cat become mayor and actually do anything for the town of Talkeetna?\n",
      "Good question! Definitely more of a symbolic gesture. Otherwise that town would be in shambles! If I had a mouse problem I may consider getting a cat though.\n",
      "It kind of makes sense that sculpture use to be an Olympic event because in the old days there were tons of cat scultpures!\n",
      "Oh thats true I never thought of that. Yeah I know in certain cultures, like the Egyptians, that used to worship cats.\n",
      "It's also interesting that past culture never mentioned kissing because it's a new development.\n",
      "When did kissing first become a thing? It has always been odd to me but it is a universal signal of affection so I guess everyone does it now and it's normal!\n",
      "I guess maybe they used poetry to show love to others since they were big into literature?? I mean they took all the name for the Hobbit characters out of dvergatal, so poems were important!\n",
      "Oh I didn't know that. I love the Hobbit/Lord of The Rings. Now I know where their names come from!\n",
      "Very cool! Nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How's it going? Do you like cats? I have one myself but have no idea which one of the 70 breeds it is\n",
      "I have 3 cats! I didn't know there were so many different breeds!\n",
      "Yea they're pretty cool. They have a cat cafe near my house where you can buy coffee and spend time with cats, I wonder if it's the same as the cat cafes in japan and taiwan\n",
      "I had no idea they had those around! Do you like to read too? The fda burned six tons of literature in an act of us censorship\n",
      "Yea, I wonder what books the fda burned, makes me want to read them more now\n",
      "me too! This sounds fun though. There is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel. I wake up in the morning...\n",
      "hmm, that sounds like a fun challenge to come up with the worst possible opening sentence. I'd just write\" k, whatever\"\n",
      ":) that might work! In 1953 sir winston churchill won a nobel prize, and it was in literature, not peace. What?\n",
      "That's interesting, I wonder what Churchill wrote about that got him a nobel prize, wonder if it was about WWII\n",
      "Maybe so! I should look that up. This is wild! Architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpture were olympic events from 1912 until 1952.\n",
      "I never knew that, sound's interesting, I wonder if poetry was ever an event, Poetry does come from a Greek word\n",
      "I think it's from Poiesis. Could see Poetry battles in the olympics?\n",
      "Demetri Martin would probably earn a medal, I cannot even wrap my head around trying to write a 224 word palindrome poem\n",
      "Thats crazy! This would be so cool to hear! Poetry has a long history, dating back to prehistorical times with the creation of hunting poetry in Africa.\n",
      "That's pretty neat but I wonder how researchers could even figure out it was poetry and how it rhymed\n",
      "maybe this will help answer it. Some of the earliest written poetry in Africa can be found among the Pyramid Texts.\n",
      "Lol, hylographic poetry on pyramids, now that is insane\n",
      "They call it griot court poetry.\n",
      "interesting, it's pretty crazy there is poems that are depressing read forward but inspiring read backwards, that must take a lot of time and creativity to make\n",
      "I had no idea! I wouldn't even think about reading them backwards! The Japanese alphabet, when recited in order, forms a poem\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, Did you know they have cat cafes in Japan and Taiwan?\n",
      "Never heard about that, sounds strange wonder how it works?\n",
      "I don't know, people pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks.\n",
      "Wow strange. I did hear that when a cat reaches 15 years old it would have already spent 10 years sleeping. \n",
      "I believe that, all my cats do is sleep! Did you know Stubbs the cat is the mayor in a town in Alaska!\n",
      "Yeah since 1997 right? Now that is truly strange. The cat in the opening scene of the Godfather was a stray.\n",
      "I would like to watch that again and look for that. ha\n",
      "Yeah i remember the Don stroking a cat while he was meeting with some ppl. You know there are more than 70 breeds of cat.\n",
      "Yes, Did you know the FDA burned 6 tons of literature?\n",
      "Now why would they want to destroy so many bodies of works? Did you know that literature use to be in the Olympics?\n",
      "Acts of censorship. Yes, I wish they still did that. I would love to see painting and sculpture etc. \n",
      "Me too apparently the events were held between 1912 and 1952. Poems on the other hand can be interesting as well. \n",
      "I agree. Did you know poetry dates back to prehistoric times. Starting with hunting poetry in Africa.\n",
      "Wow! You know there a poem when read normally is depressing but when read backward is uplifting?\n",
      "I\n",
      "Early poems in the Eurasian continent evolved from folk songs, like Chinese Shijing.\n",
      "Yes, I knew about the backward poems, isn't that interesting. Folk songs, that makes sense. Some of the earliest African poems comes from Pyramid texts, written in the 5th century BCE.\n",
      "I think you mean the 25th century. However some of earliest western -Asian poetry include the Epic of Gilgamesh and was written in Sumerian. \n",
      "Yes, my keys are sticking. Thank you your right the 25th century! Wow, I am surprised Edgar Allan Poe only got paid $9 for The Raven!\n",
      "I figured as much, lol. Yes that does not seem right. Have you ever seen the read the Hobbit?\n",
      "Yes, I have heard of it. Have you heard of the old Icelantic poem Dvergatal?\n",
      "Yes i have i was going to tell you that all the characters named in the Hobbit come from the old Icelandic poem. Nice chatting with you. \n",

      "Good Morning!  Elon Musk is at it again - the SpaceX program is going places!\n",
      "I agree! He's even sending things to the International Space Station now!\n",
      "Yes - proof that the private sector is more than capable in this industry to succeed and thrive.  Wonder how NASA feels?\n",
      "I'm sure they are always wanting to get back more into it. The place I work for manages the Cape Canaveral Launch Pad so we are doing more and more business with Space X than NASA these days.\n",
      "That sounds like an interesting job!  I was amazed when SpaceX was able to land the boosters back on the pads - I got so used to them just falling into the ocean.  The boosters are now reusable, which cuts the costs dramatically.\n",
      "I wonder how much money they save doing that! AI has come a long ways, not only with that, but with nonprofits spreading the advancement of AI!\n",
      "Very true - and I find the non-profit component interesting because that's usually not the first thing one thinks of when discussing AI - I wonder who is behind it?\n",
      "I wonder that too, I will have to research it for sure! I'm sure it's not as cool as the Russians building a computer than ran on water.\n",
      "You mean a computer running on hydroelectricity or a CPU that actually uses water for power - I need to know more!!!\n",
      "I'm guessing hydroelectricity haha. But who knows! Make sure you don't smoke by an Apple computer though because it voids the warranty!\n",
      "Smoking cigarettes I assume - I wonder if they've updated that policy to include vaping?!?!?! \n",
      "They ought to! Speaking of computers, robots are crazy lol. They can even debone chicken with surgical precision!\n",
      "Oh man, I hate deboning chicken!  But it also makes me think that humans are next!!!  What will happen when they turn on us?\n",
      "It will be the terminator all over again!!! PREPARE YOURSELF!!!!!! lol I'm sure it's going to make our lives easier!\n",
      "There is going to be a point where making our lives easier is going to = making our lives boring...  Like an old French proverb I live by:  Sometimes patience is mistaken for laziness \n",
      "You couldn't have said it any better. That's about as lazy as the us military using the xbox 360 to control their EOD robots. But oh well, I'm sure it helps a lot!\n",
      "Is an EOD a drone/attack drone.  I am in favor of those because of the lack of risk for US soldiers to be harmed or killed.  Who they are attacking and why is a totally different discussion.... \n",
      "I agree with you on that statement but EOD stands for Explosive Ordinance Disposal so that helps just about everything in this earth!\n",
      "Aaaaahhhhh - yes!  That is a great application for robots - I know there are still landmines in far flung parts of the world from conflicts of long ago...\n",
      "I'm sure that will take ages to finally get rid of! I do like how Stanford teaches a free AI class to anybody through Google Hangout!\n",
      "I'll have to look into those classes, I enjoy remote learning!  Hey - in case this ends abruptly - it's been really great chatting with you!!!\n",
      "Thanks you as well! Have a good one!\n",

      "Hello\n",
      "Hey. Do you use YouTube much?\n",
      "*Yes! I love YouTube I use it everyday! Do you use it?\n",
      "Yeah I do. Do you know what the most disliked video in YouTube history is?\n",
      "I want to say its the music video baby by Justin Bieber\n",
      "That's Correct. Do you have any pets?\n",
      "No, I wish I did, I have friends that own pets. I used to own a fish.\n",
      "Did you know that in Japan there are more pets than kids under 15?\n",
      "Yes! That's so crazy, but pets are better than little kids.\n",
      "I read that there are more pet tigers in the U.S. than living in the wild in Asia. How depressing.\n",
      "Yea that is sad, but at the same time its good that they will live on despite being endangered and poached. \n",
      "You know much about animal cloning?\n",
      "A good amount of information, it's a very interesting topic. You have nay questions? \n",
      "What was the first cloned pet?\n",
      "I think it was a cat named \"Copy Cat\". You can even get your dog cloned for 150K in Korea.\n",
      "Cool name. I'm not sure I'd want a clone of my dog.\n",
      "I would if I had that kind of crazy money but it's so many shelter animals it would not be smart.\n",
      "Have you ever used Pandora Radio?\n",
      "Yes! I enjoy the service, How about you?\n",
      "I used to use it but it seems like a ripoff for artists. Aloe Blacc had 168 million streams of his music & only make $12K.\n",
      "Wow! that is tough but at least he made some good money.\n",
      "I agree.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Are you a big youtube user?  I am!\n",
      "I'm a very big user of youtube. Does most of their content is uploaded by individuals and media corporations?\n",
      "Yes!  It was created in Feb. of 2005 by 3 former PayPal employees.\n",
      "Wow!! I didn't know this. Do you happen to know what the names are of those 3 former Paypal employees?\n",
      "They were Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim!\n",
      "Thanks. Did you know that Youtube is the 2nd largest search engine on the internet.\n",
      "I know that now! lol  Netflix and youtube make half of the peak internet traffic in North America.\n",
      "Wow. That is a very interesting fact but it does make sense. Do you happen to listen to Pandora radio?\n",
      "I do listen to it sometimes at work.\n",
      "Do you know if Pandora is available everywhere or just here in the United States?\n",
      "I'm not sure about that.  I know they have a messed up financial sheet.  lol  They have a net income of negative $16 million dollars despite having $274 million in revenue.\n",
      "Wow. That is very bad and very bad management of funds.\n",
      "No doubt!  Aloe Blacc only received $12,000 in royalties from Pandora for 168 million streams of his music.  Ouch.\n",
      "That is depressing. I feel very bad for Aloe Blacc. Did anyone try to acquire Pandora in the past?\n",
      "That I'm not sure of.  Pandora now streams stand up comedy in addition to music.\n",
      "I read somewhere that Sirius XM Holdings have intended to acquire Pandora for $3.5 billion. That is interesting that they are streaming comedy as well as music.\n",
      "Holy smokes that's a lot of money.  Taylor Swift removed her music from Spotify, but kept it on Pandora.  I wonder why she did that?\n",
      "That is strange. I think it must of been some kind of disagreement between Taylor Swift with Spotify but I'm not sure.\n",
      "It would have had to have been something like that.  Pandora works by using insight gained through the music genome project, which is an effort to capture the essence of music at the most fundamental level.\n",
      "Wow that is very interesting. I read somewhere that Pandora is a freemium service.\n",
      "Yes it is!  That's what I like about it that you don't have to pay! lol  It's been fun chatting with you this morning!  Have a good day!\n",
      "It was very nice chatting with you as well!! Thanks\n",

      "do you like robots?\n",
      "They are interesting. do you know who invented the word?\n",
      "I am not sure of that actually, who was it?\n",
      "it was Isaac Asimov, the word was robotics\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice. Michael Jackson planned to built a robot of himself , it was 50 foot tall\n",
      "Nice, but did he have a reason for that?\n",
      "Yes he wanted it to roam around the desert, not much of a reason really\n",
      "wow. they have made arms that can be controlled by thoughts\n",
      "wow that is impressive, are they in the market to buy?\n",
      "Yes persons with disabilities can use them\n",
      "Cool. And there are some others that can be controlled by rat brains\n",
      "Wow that is something. Have you heard of the Curiosity robot in Mars?\n",
      "I have. THe one with rats,the robots change personality depending on the rat brain\n",
      "Wow cool. Did you know Kristen Steward coauthored a paper on AI?\n",
      "Cool. Stanford has free AI classes and uses Google Hangouts to help them with that\n",
      "Cool. there are AI system that can grow crops and tend to livestock\n",
      "Wow. THere is even an NGO for the advancement of AI\n",
      "Cool. Do you use your computer much?\n",
      "All the time actually. the computer for the space shuttle has only 1 mb of ram\n",
      "Wow that is small. Do you know who wrote the first computer algorithm?\n",
      "Hmmm I really have no idea. who was it?\n",
      "It was a woman by the name of Ada Lovelace\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you heard about CIMON?\n",
      "Yeah I have, he's going to be flying with spaceX\n",
      "Apparently CIMON can smile. CIMON is the first AI technology going to the space station.\n",
      "That's pretty cool. CIMON is also capable of conversation and technical support. But that's about all for now.\n",
      "They say SIMON is going to be kind of like Alexa, and to help scientists with experiments.\n",
      "CIMON is the acronym for Crew Interactive Mobile Companion.\n",
      "That's interesting. Airbus built it and Watson (IBM's supercomputer) power it.\n",
      "I hear it will be guided by cameras and voice commands, and able to hold a conversation.\n",
      "That's cool. But I'm kind of concerned AI will take over a lot of human jobs. What about you?\n",
      "I'm hesitant as well. But I think if they slowly release this type of technology it will be fine.\n",
      "Airbu's lead system engineer said that they don't plan to replace crew members with artificial intelligence and that it's just there to support the crew. So that's good.\n",
      "Yeah exactly, they are still there to support the crew, in the end they will always be required. \n",
      "SpaceX has been flying cargo to the station for years but has yet to fly humans.\n",
      "SpaceX plans to fly its future flights on its next-generation iteration, the block 5, a configuration that the company says will be suited to fly astronauts as soon as this year.\n",
      "That will be exciting to see.\n",
      "It sure will! SpaceX has been also flying cargo to the station for years. But it hasn't flown humans yet.\n",
      "Yeah, SpaceX sent 5,900 pounds of research, crew supplies and hardware.\n",
      "Thats very interesting. SpaceX hit a series of milestones with its launch. It was the 15th mission to resupply the station, the 14th time SpaceX reflew one of its boosters, and the fourth time it had reflown one of its Dragon capsules.\n",
      "Eventually AI may be able to explore deep space, the moon, or Mars.\n",
      "I can't wait till that day, it will be a great day in our history!\n",
      "It certainly will be interesting to gain new knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello.  Have you heard much about the new AI that SpaceX is flying to the ISS?\n",
      "Oh yeah. Thats interesting.\n",
      "I think it's interesting that they are sending one up at this time.  It sounds like the functionality will be limited, but I hope they would be able to expand its capabilities soon.\n",
      "I wonder how they contol it. I heard the military uses an X-box controller to control one of their robots.\n",
      "They use the controllers for explosives demolition.  For the AI being sent to the ISS, it's much more along the lines of Alexa.  It's limited to being a guide.\n",
      "Wow. That really is interesting. Do you know when they are sending it. \n",
      "I believe it has already been flown up as of this last year.  I'm not sure if it's been fully implemented on the station yet, though.\n",
      "Its crazy how far we have come with technology. I guess they can use a rat brain to control a robot. It actually hanges personality depending on the brain use. Makes you think about if they could put a human brain in one what it could do.\n",
      "It's all a matter of programming.  For rat testing, it's a very simple robot that can be controlled.  For other tasks, it takes a bit more control and precision.\n",
      "Wow. You know a lot about this stuff. I think just the fact that they an use a rats brain to control a robot shows that it an be done. I mean the computer used to be the size of a room just to do small calculations. Now They can do so much more. \n",
      "The increase in tech is amazing, to say the least.  From computers as big as a room, they improved to allow things like the Space Shuttle program.  But, even then, the primary systems only ran on 1MB of RAM.  Now, we have 1000s of times that memory in our cell phones.\n",
      "Yeah crazy huh. I bet one day they have robots that are very similiar to humans. It makes me want to learn more about it. I hear that Stanford has a free class on AI. I might have to heck that out.\n",
      "Unfortunately, AI will get used to further marketing ploys, though.  Take a look at Facebook.  They intend to continue developing an AI system to \"predict user actions\", but what that really means is that they can better sell targeted advertising.\n",
      "Well yeah. Thats how the world works though. Its all about the mighty dollar. \n",
      "I just think that given some direction, AI could be used for much more utilitarian purposes.  If an AI can beat all human records in the game 2048, it shows that it can make predictive moves, and be able to process information better/faster than humans in some cases.  This type of AI should be able to be used for research of things like cancers.\n",
      "That is a good idea. Have it help humanity. Better than the 50 foot tall moon walking robot Michael Jackson wated to create to roam the desserts of Las Vegas.\n",
      "That would just be creepy to see in the desert.  I would much rather deal with a HAL type of AI, even if it did end up trying to kill me.\n",
      "Lol. I dont know about that.\n",
      "HAL was the AI on the spaceship used for 2001, A Space Odyssey.  It was a play on IBM where the name was derived by subtracting one letter from each of IBM.  In the end HAL goes a bit nutso.  The glowing red eye that they gave it just added to the creepy factor.\n",
      "Oh yeah. I havent seen it yet. Is it good.\n",
      "It's a classic.  It can serve as a warning for letting self learning AI loose, but then, so can movies like Terminator.\n",

      "So what do you think about this ambiguity about actual square footage in houses?\n",
      "I think that it can be sketchy, people can be deceived easily, usually you buy a terrain and trust the square footage is right. \n",
      "Well, not for houses apparently. Some places measure the exterior vs the interior to get the sq. footage and it makes quite a difference.\n",
      "I can imagine, I wish there was a better method, but I believe theres just too much controversy about this.\n",
      "I guess so.  I also think that people buy houses for things other than the sq. footage.  Location, amenities, schools, etc.  Not like for commercial real estate where you are buying just the space period.\n",
      "Yeah I agree, there are other aspects that are really important. I believe that you can compare homes and this can be a good way to have a better estimate\n",
      "It's odd though.  Everything is so standardized today.  This has slipped through the cracks.\n",
      "Its crazy how if you add a basement the square footing will go up as well, for example a two story home with 3200 feet would increase to 4800 feet with the basement alone.\n",
      "It is crazy! Do you do DIY?  I do and I watch a lot of YouTube for those types of videos.\n",
      "Yes I actually have a DIY project in my home right now. Im watching YouTube to complete it.\n",
      "It is such a great thing.  There is actually NOTHING I have tried to look up that I didn't find!\n",
      "I know, there is a ton of info available, even material from corporations like CBS and BBC, I think YouTube is a great invention. \n",
      "They are the second largest search engine on the internet.  I myself usually just google what I want to find and then it takes me to YouTube.  The whole channels thing on YouTube confuses me.\n",
      "Yeah, it can get quite confusing, do you also use Pandora Radio? I like that it also streams comedy and I use it on my way to the office.\n",
      "I do have an account.  Mostly I listen to NPR radio.\n",
      "NPR radio is pretty good, have you heard about the music genome project in pandora?\n",
      "No, what is it?\n",
      "So basically it compiles feedback and insight from users and then using over 450 attributes describes songs and organizes them via a complicated algorithm.\n",
      "Sounds interesting!  Do you have a pet?  I have a moss ball from Japan.\n",
      "I do have a cat, what is a moss ball? havent heard that one before.\n",
      "They grow in the sea of Japan.  They're pretty neat!  They're called Marimo.  Look them up on YouTube!  Nice chat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good morning!  Do you like cats?\n",
      "I like that they keep the mice away.\n",
      "Same here.  There are people in Japan and Taiwan that pay by the hour to drink and play with cats.\n",
      "Sounds like something that they could get for free.\n",
      "I know what you mean.  People can be different.  In alaska a town has a cat as it's mayor.\n",
      "Its probably like a town of ten people or something. Funny that they did it though. Made a cat mayor.\n",
      "It is funny.  It's been their mayor since 1997!\n",
      "Yeah the town is called talkeetna. I may have to look that up later.\n",
      "Did you hear about the physicist who published his cat as a coauthor?\n",
      "Just so he could write using first person plural. \n",
      "Exactly.  That's odd in a way.  He could write a different way or just accept being criticized for writing the way he wanted instead of naming his cat coauthor.\n",
      "Did you know that cats sleep two thirds of he time.\n",
      "I didn't know it was that much. I know they sleep a lot though.\n",
      "Yep, when a cat reaches 15 years old. He has slept almost 10 years of his life.\n",
      "Wow! That's kind of sad in  a way.  Did you know that there are more than 70 breeds of cats?\n",
      "Thats a lot of breeds. \n",
      "Yes it is.  70 different breeds of sleeping animals!\n",
      "Lol. They also hunt and poop. \n",
      "Lol!  Yes they do at that.  On a different topic, do you like tennis?\n",
      "Not reall, but I do know that a black man won the first us open title.\n",
      "That's cool.  I know those games can last a while. The longest went on for 11 hours over 3 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello there, do you play the piano?\n",
      "Hello, I can play a little. What about you? \n",
      "No, but I really wish that I could I think it is so cool. \n",
      "DId you know an aluminum grand piano was built for the lounge of the airship Hindenburg.\n",
      "No, but that sounds just outright crazy to me.  I wonder what it sounded like though. \n",
      "I wonder as well. Back in 1930, the BBC decided there was no news worth reporting so they broadcast piano music instead.\n",
      "I think that is awesome, I wish we could have more days like that. \n",
      "I do too. Do you know much about Mars?\n",
      "I don't know too much, but know its called the red planet. \n",
      "Sounds on Mars have a higher pitch than they do on Earth.\n",
      "That is true, I know that Lichens would be able to live on mars too. \n",
      "That's interesting. Looks like cyanobacteria.\n",
      "Yeah I think you are right those as well, very interesting. \n",
      "A Mars colonization project planned for 2023 will be funded by creating a reality TV show.\n",
      "What the heck, I wonder who will sign up for that show?\n",
      "HAHA no idea! \n",
      "Did you know a satellite was lost on mars because a company used the imperial system while nasa used the metric?\n",
      "I did not know that lol. If you fly to Mars under constant 1g acceleration, it will only take 2 or 3 days.\n",
      "That sounds like one hell of a ride if you ask me. \n",
      "I bet haha. Do you like poetry?\n",
      "Yeah I do, but don't read too much of it. I like Poe for sure. \n",
      "Great time chatting with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you see the movie Black Panther?\n",
      "I did see it. Did you see it?\n",
      "Yeah! One of the best movies in 2018 I think.  What did you think?\n",
      "I really liked it. I thought the casting was great and the writing was great too! What did you think?\n",
      "I really liked the director Ryan Coogler.  I was really impressed with his Creed movie.   Did you have a favorite actor?\n",
      "In that movie, it was the sister. Overall, no. Coogler did a wonderful job! I think that has opened up a lot more films for him.\n",
      "Are you a fan of superhero of comic book movies in general?\n",
      "I do like them but my interest has faded. I feel like they are good but I was more into them when like x-men came out and iron man. You?\n",
      "I'm kind of a comic book geek so love it when new marvel movies come out.  Cool fact, in the comic book universe.  Black Panther is actually the richest superhero.\n",
      "I read that. I like how Wakanda was portrayed in the movie. That's what $500B gets you...\n",
      "Yeah with all that tech!  Had always thought Tony Stark or Bruce Wayne was richer.\n",
      "I am not a fan of Tony Stark in since the civil war movie. Do you still like him?\n",
      "Don't like Tony Stark as much.  But do like Robert Downey J.\n",
      "What do you like better, xmen or marvel?\n",
      "You know they both had their good points.  Movie wise they both had award winning actors.   \n",
      "Yeah. I really liked chadwick boseman. He attended a prestigious oxford theatre program.\n",
      "Heard he had a benefactor to go there.  Someone famous I think.\n",
      "That's true. Denzel Washington. Nice memory!\n",
      "Ah, Denzel!  Man, did you see him in Book of Eli?  Crazy scene at the beginning with a cat.\n",
      "I did see it but do not remember that scene. What happened?\n",
      "I'm a cat lover so I was bothered by his survivalist tactic of hunting cats for food.  I'm just a sucker for felines.\n",
      "Aren't we all. Nice chatting with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "I am well, thank you. Did you know that art, music and poetry were once olympic sports??\n",
      "I did not. I did know there is a 224 word palindrome.\n",
      "The 274-line poem??\n",
      "No, 225 words. Poe only received $9 for the Raven. What a ripoff!\n",
      "Would $9 have been fair at the time? I have never read the Raven. \n",
      "It is a huge classic. Like only getting $9 for Huckleberry Finn...\n",
      "Never read Huckleberry Finn either. \n",
      "What about to kill a mockingbird? Either way, the Raven was a huge poem. Poe was a huge author!\n",
      "Oh yes, definitely have read that. I know who Poe is, never read his work. I did read one Emily Dickinson poem before.\n",
      "Which one did you read? I wish I liked the classics more so I seemed more refined but alas, I do not.\n",
      "I cannot remember the name of it but I remember the beginning. I cannot get into them either. They drag on too much.\n",
      "I tried reading king leer the other day and had no idea what the hell he was talking about. I wish I knew.\n",
      "Is there a Cliffnotes? LOL\n",
      "Probably. But I did not think of that so now I will get those, read them, talk about it at cocktail parties, and seem really smart. Good plan!\n",
      "You can try out C.S. Lewis' and Tolkien's game. Although I am not sure how any of that would be funny.\n",
      "I would be depressed if they made fun of me... So humiliating.\n",
      "If C.S. Lewis or Tolkien made fun of you? Or party guests?\n",
      "\n",
      "Both! But if professionals, Lewis or Tolkien, did, I would be angry!\n",
      "Maybe they wouldn't have done well at the Olympics so screw them LOL\n",
      "HA! Nice chatting with you!\n"
