- (laughs) Do I look good? Oh, this is gonna be used, isn't it? (laughs) What's up ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. And welcome to the first episode of the Trash Taste Podcast.

- How are you? The official first episode

- The official first episode, we've finally made it. I'm your host for today Joey and joining me every week is Garnt and Connor.

- Hey guys.

- What's up.

- So yeah, is finally happening.

- It's finally happening. Oh my God. You do not know how long we've been planning this and how long we've wanted this to have this.

- Like how long has it been? I mean, we've been conceptualize in this podcast for like what? Over a year.

- Yeah Yeah, t's been year, a year, at least possibly years.

- Cause I mean, when we decided we were gonna move to Japan, I think the first thing in our mind was we've been gonna make a podcast.

- Yeah.

- Yeah.

- But I think even before that, the idea of just us finally getting into a room and just, you know, not doing a one of collabo doing like a continual collabo has been, you know in our minds for ages.

- Yeah I wanna say several years at least.

- Yeah.

- At least almost as known as like along is half known, (laughs) You don't do really cool a podcast.

- I'm just left out here. (laughing) I was tacked on at the end, no.

- Let's talk about that, like how we first met each other because I think that's a good introduction to this podcast and how we've grown.

- Yes because you never know there might be someone watching who doesn't know like who is that guy? Who is that guy? Who's this guy?

- Exactly, right.

- Hi, I'm Connor, hi. (laughing) And another channel.

- Hopefully surprised if there is someone watching first episode who doesn't know like who's three of us?

- Yeah exactly.

- Maybe.

- Or maybe they've seen us.

- You see if you did then can you please tell us in the comments well how you found this video. (Garnt laughs)

- Because we're just so famous (Garnt laughs) then you've not this for not knowing who we are there.

- I swear. So, yeah let's actually, you know what, before we talk about that, we should probably talk about what this podcast is.

- Oh yeah.

- That's true.

- We just like rushing into things 'cause there's so, we're so like excited.

- I'm finally (mumbles)

- Who's so excited to get this thing off the ground? So basically Trash Taste as the name implies is a podcast where we us three and maybe sometimes even a guest you never know, comes onto the show and we basically talk about our Trash Taste. Whether it comes to Anime, Manga, and Otaku culture in general, or you never know, we might talk about whatever the fuck we want. Who knows?

- Yeah, 'cause if, if you didn't know, we are all like Anime YouTubers.

- So

- No why? (laughing)

- Bro

- This guy called the Anime Man. (laughing)

- I really felt myself for that one definitely.

- This guy called CDAWG VA which

- My God

- Garnt that too.

- What is VAsten for?

- Virginia is all the comments (laughing)

- He's from Virginia.

- It's okay, 'cause the amount of years that I still get comments, which is like, they call me Gigg UK and not Gigguk. (laughing)

- How do you do that? (laughing)

- I mean listen, people might call you Gigg UK but I still know you as the animation (mumbles) (laughing) But AC in the thumbnails, in the old thumbnails. That's how I knew I was watching an Anime Zone.

- Actually I'm not curious. How long have you been watching my videos? Because this ties into how we first met as well.

- I've known you I mean, I obviously, as I said, I've known you since the Anime Zone.

- That's like...

- Which is like a long time. But I think I, like, I watched you probably not knowing that you will like this like YouTube personality.

- Yeah same.

- Because like, I was in like a weird state. I don't think I discovered YouTubers until maybe about 2011.

- Yeah.

- Maybe because they'd been around for a long time since then.

- Yeah.

- And obviously you've been around since then. But I never like went onto YouTube being like I'm gonna go check out my favorite YouTube. (Garnt laughs) I kind of just use YouTube up until around 2011. I think I just use YouTube as to like either watch music or listen to music videos or just to like, Oh this is an interesting looking video. And I think a couple of your videos will like the interesting looking ones. I think I remember actually the first video I ever watched from you surprisingly was not EvAbridged.

- Oh share okay.

- I watched EvAbridged when I like the idea of an came around.

- And an bridged series.

- Yeah and I was like, oh a bridging. That sounds fun, but tedious as fun. (laughs) But no, I think the first video I watched from you was, Oh God, I probably wanna say it's the Summer Wars Review you did? Oh my God.

- Like the one you did like 2000

- What's going (mumbles) what's the fuck man?

- I never even saw your EvAbridged. I just, cause I didn't watch Davis. There was a lot of watched your bri... I don't know what is sounds. like, I wanna watch that So I think I watched some of your stuff. I just knew you always the British one.

- Yeah. (laughing)

- The British. That's my brand name.

- 'Cause there was like, it was like Tristin and then you in my mind. I think that was it to a lot of people when I was, when I got into it like 2013, I start watching YouTube a lot, especially anime stuff.

- Right.

- Yeah, but so how long have you been doing YouTube for?

- I've been doing it since 2007. (laughs)

- He's like an actual OG.

- I'll have to like Trace Back, but I'm thinking I'm like the fifth ever Anime YouTuber of all the time might be like four, four fifth. But I've been there since the beginning. I can recite the entire history of Anime YouTube.

- Which we're definitely gonna do with like a future

- Not for this episode, 'cause there's a lot to say, but for now I remember the first, I can't remember the exact first video I saw from you, Joey. But I remember your videos just getting recommended to be constantly. And I'm just like my first thought was how was no one taking the handle, the anime (mumbles) (laughing) I've been on usual for so many fucking years and just now someone it's called the Anime. There's no fun.

- No but the thing is, someone did take the hand land because that's why like on like even my YouTube URL and like my Twitter and everything, it's the Anime Man but it's I it's a one. Because somebody over a Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, like YouTube someone took the Anime Man. He was like this guy who never uploaded any videos. (Garnt laughs) And he's been around since like 2007. Yeah it's always just like, "men you are such a son of a bitch." So I was like, well, what am I gonna do? All right fuck (mumbles) to one. Somehow that caught on and I don't know how the fuck but yeah. I mean I've regret that name. Let's be honest. (laughing)

- I mean, it works for as you ever. Because the reason I was called the Anime Zone, is because,

- You're an Anime.

- Yeah, yeah because back

- He will sing the song.

- But that back in the day when you could just type an Anime and it was just all my videos. I'm like, man, I've won this game I've playing the game correctly.

- And then I came along, I was like, hold my beat. (laughing)

- Exactly.

- You're in the zone, I'm the man.

- But I remember the first time I have was, I mean I don't think I ever saw one of your videos. The first time I heard about you Conner was actually when you "auditioned" for one of my Abridged series.

- So really?

- Yeah, yeah is yes so I haven't told this story to Joey yet. So I did a casting call for one of the in minutes videos, right. And I told people to send in their some of the videos

- I'm trying to remember what this was now because I remember.

- It's going all the way back. And so I asked people to send in their demo reel and most people send in their demo reel and this guy, this fuck doesn't even send in a demo reel. He just sends in a YouTube video of him doing League of Legends character impressions (laughing)

- So why you should also never do that yourself.

- Yeah, yeah don't, don't do that.

- When someone asked for demos, send a demo reel, you don't know I think at the time, I didn't have a character demo.

- Do I still don't have a character demo reel because I never needed it. Okay, his things were a lot of character demos on Twitter, you'll hear them. They've really, really bad.

- Yeah.

- And the thing is when you're making it yourself, you don't have anyone to say like, "hey you displease kind of sucks." (laughs) So like every time I've made a professional demo, I've had like a director who's at hand shows in every scene and told me what to do. And then it sounds good because someone who can hear your voice and be like, how do this and that. Back then, I didn't know that. And this is before I started doing a lot of professional stuff and that.

- Yeah.

- That's a great way to introduce someone. This is why, this is also another thing you shouldn't send a demo to someone if it's garbage 'cause you guy, like this guy still remembers that shit

- I even remember because he was the only person who didn't send a demo reel but just sent a YouTube video of him doing impressions. Never send like if there is, like a checklist of things not to send for a demo, do not send character impression.

- That's such a big, that's such a big dick move. (laughing) It's like, I don't even need cast demo reels. My impressions are good enough. (laughs)

- I'm sorry about that.-

- So, I mean, would you remember which characters you did?

- I think so. I think there were like, I was just to bunch them manly guys from League Legends. It's just anyone with a low voice. (mumbling) (laughing) I did long still (mumbles)

- It's like, its been awesome seeing you how far you've come from sending in a character impression reel to be like.

- That was like, I thought it must have been just like a year or two after I started as well. When I still like, you think that you figure stuff out after a year but like you realize when you look back like you're still, you just didn't know share

- Because what year did you start?

- YouTube? YouTube I started 2015,

- 2015.

- 2015, I started voice acting really in like 2013, like 2014. So that gave me a big like advantage. I went into it with like a great mind microphone.

- Yeah.

- Which a lot of,

- 'Cause that voice acting.

- Yeah, and I mean, funny enough how I met you actually have the email sent to me.

- Weuh, weuh, weuh you have an email?

- I have the email.

- Before we started recording this one, we're going to talk about like how we all met one another. This guy was like, I don't think Joey remembers the first time we met. I think I do though.

- Okay, (mumbles) read the email that I. Okay this is what I had.

- Why you you sent it to me, right?

- Yeah, yeah so this was about like, how I must've been like four months into me doing YouTube. And I think I had like maybe 30, 40K subs. Yeah, I think Joey, I think he had like 900K at this time?

- Probably.

- He was something like, you had a lot. And like way more than I had. And so I sent you an email saying (mumbles) like formal. (laughing) Hello there, my name is Connor or CDawgVA on YouTube. (Garnt laughs) Why this is making any sense grammatically? (laughing) (mumbles) I wish is commas. "Hello there. My name is Connor or CDawgVA on YouTube channel here", and then.

- Channel here

- Channel here (laughing)

- Okay, here's where it starts to get real crunch again. "I've been working on a Levi versus Sebastian Rap Battle."

- Oh my God! (laughing loudly)

- Okay wait, I'll finish it then I'll explain it. "And it is about 90% complete. I noticed you recently did a Rap Battle and it was well done." Wow, I couldn't have kissed your ass more here. (laughing) "It's more of an insulting each other a character rap. I have the voice of Sebastian Michaelis, English Dub down to a tee." Wow, it's really

- Wow, wow.

- "And I was wondering if you'd like to be Levi If you wish to talk to me more about it and the logistics feel free to contact me on Skype." (laughing)

- Really Jesus. (laughing)

- I wanted the sound professional was fun or just reply to this email. Any responses, appreciate it. Kindly, Regards CDawgVA of any used my real name CDawgVA. And then Joey replied saying. "Hi there! Sure, sounds like fun." Smiley face. "I added you on Skype we can talk about it." I remember the first thing Joey sent me was like, "your voice is cool is fun."

- Yeah and I was like, I still think that it is.

- Yeah, so that's how like and to this day I thought that was so cool. You actually replied 'cause I'm not gonna lie. I'm kind of mean when I see a video normally when it's like collabo, it's normally like.

- Its normally like.

- Yeah (laughing)

- Normally like I don't know what I wanna do yet but I wanna a collabo.

- Right.

- And it's a good, you don't know what you wanna do yet. You're pitching the (mumbles) what the fuck? So that's how I met you.

- Yeah I fucking remember that too, because yeah, the the rap battle I did was so bad. Don't watch it. ♪ I could've spend more time ♪ ♪ pwning royals at chess ♪ ♪ but looks like I gotta prove to you ♪ ♪ that I'm the best. ♪ ♪ You wanna fight, little emo? ♪ ♪ Well, be my guest! ♪ ♪ I fought till the end ♪ ♪ until I got a knife in my chest. ♪

- It was pretty bad.

- It was pretty fucking battle at the time, it was the first time I ever used the green screen. It might be (cheering) even like because I was in like my tiny bedroom in Australia. There was no place to like prop up the green screen. So what I had to do, it's so ghetto. What I had to do was I had to get the green screen and literally like tape it to the ceiling and I've done exactly the same thing. Just like let it down and just stand in front of it. And like, I had no lights. You could see my shadow fucking flickering in and out the whole video. I obviously couldn't rap at the time. I'm a little bit better now, but yeah it was, what was it? It was a light no it was L from Death Note versus Lelouch from Code Geass.

- I remember.

- And I played Lelouche and another friend of mine played L.

- Yeah.

- And I think that video has like half a million views. I don't know how?

- Yeah

- I mean this is back when it was like Epic Rap Battles of History.

- Yeah we basically wanted to do an history but with no cost plays (laughs)

- It's a just.

- Rapping in front of a green screen. (laughing loudly)

- Checks out that's like 2015 YouTube.

- But basically like that kind of somehow popped off for my channel and then yeah. And then you.

- 'Cause I actually was writing that with Gray Fox at the time.

- Yeah.

- Amazing guy. And I thought like we had like a burger. We had like so many like Grey Fox had made the tracks for many beats and they were like amazing.

- Man sending emails. That's such a boom away to slide into something. (laughs)

- Not to mention, we added each other on Skype. (laughing) The back, the good old days of Skype.

- And then I think like your Skype account got hacked or something like a sort.

- Yeah it got hacked twice

- That I know how I met you, but it was weird 'cause I think Sydney. I saw Sydney was following me.

- Yeah Sydsnap my fiance.

- Yeah and I think I followed her back so I knew of Sydney and then Sydney DM me. She'll say that she didn't Sydney DM first. (laughing) And she was like, you're going to MCM which is a convention in London And I was like yeah okay. And then Sydney was like, "come, come to this meetup, you can meet me in Garnt." I didn't get to meet Garnt he was too busy. (laughing loudly) So I turned up like an idiot like, I'm like sea dog and stuff. (mumbles) (laughs loudly) At the time I had like 200 K subscribers. So it was like a substantial amount for that time period.

- He was funny because you had a audience that was vastly different from every other Anime YouTuber.

- I mean still like that to this.

- [Both] Yeah, yeah.

- That's true. It's gone like a lot less so at the time and around 2000, the peak of it at 2014, I had a 93% female audience.

- Which is unheard of.

- I think his nickname when first met him was the 93%. (laughing loudly) We would just like how's the 90% doing? (laughing loudly)

- Okay I got bullied for it. (laughing)

- I really wanna start calling you (mumbles) (laughing)

- It's like 55, 60% now. It's leveled up.

- It's like you are going to enjoy. (laughing) Who's crazy though. And that's like a whole YouTube is in Anime. All dudes there was like one or two girls but just all dude. So every time I turned up to like an Anime YouTuber meetup, everyone's like, "fuck who the is this guy?" How's he got 200K, how does, how did he get that? How would no one of us know who he is?

- Why this guy from Virginia? (laughing) What the fuck.

- Yeah, so I mean that time had gone. And then we went from there.

- Yeah can I tell the story about how the first time we met?

- Sure?

- Yeah, 'cause.

- I don't know where you're gonna start this case.

- Okay so the first time we met in person, so it was like a 2000 and is it 17

- [Both] or 16 or 17?

- I think so, I knew Joey. I didn't know that he knew who I was.

- Right, and vice versa. I knew Garnt, but I didn't know if he knew me.

- Yeah, so this was back when I had, like, if you didn't know, I took a hiatus on YouTube for like two years because like got a real time, a real job and everything like that. And in that time I had gone from being like one of the most popular Anime YouTubers to just, you know someone who had taken a hiatus. And in that time Joey had like exploded like you've reached numbers that's back in my time, I didn't know was even fucking possible. Like you were like close to a million, you were like be like (mumbles) at the time. So the first time, so the first time I saw Joey, we were like in Little Tokyo or something?

- Yeah I remember exactly where it was too. It was that part in like the back half of Little Tokyo. Wrack it's like underneath a building and you go into where there, it's like a figuring shop there in. And you were walking with Jeff, right?

- Yeah, yeah that's what a Jeff. 'Cause I think Jeff said hello to Misty 'cause they were both tall motherfucking (laughing) So he was just like standing next to two fucking skyscrapers while we're just hanging out. And I remember looking at you and you looked at me and we didn't say shit to each other. And I thought this, I thought this motherfucking must hate me. This, motherfucker hates me.

- And at the same time I like gone, like looked at each other in the eyes and in my head I was like, this guy definitely hates me. (laughing loudly) This guy hates my guts.

- So I'm just like man, Joey is such an arrogant piece of shit man. (laughing) Like I can't believe this guy.

- I remember we shook hands. We were like, "hi I'm Joey, nice to me." And you're like, "hi, I'm Garnt, nice to meet you." And that was it.

- And that was it, that's was the same.

- It was so awkward.

- Had never heard this story

- Well because the only people who were there was Misty, Jeff and Arche. Just thinking, us too. So it was like very small. And then what? Like, fast-forward like what? Who he is?

- I think it was just, I think it was next year, it might've been even less than that. When I came to a trip, went onto a trip to Japan or something and then.

- You randomly DMed me

- Yeah, yeah, yeah I was like, for some reason he follows me. So maybe he doesn't hate me.

- May be he is cool.

- May be he is cool. So yeah, we we DMed each other and then we met in Japan and then we just like instantly just like fucking great friends, you know?

- Yeah and from that point. We went to in his no we met up in our Cobre.

- And we like hang out a little bit and then we went to in Izakaya in Ueno

- Yeah, yeah.

- Till like two in the morning or something like something ridiculous like that. We missed the last train.

- And then we were like.

- It sounds like a bromance. (laughing)

- No.

- We missed the last train. We had so much fun together. (laughing)

- 'Cause we had the moment when we just, were singing in there Izakaya and I was like, I thought you hated me.

- And I was like, how don't you hate on me. (laughing) So we don't hate each other.

- And then after that we had like a Karaoke Night where we...

- Yeah. I think it was like a few days later.

- Yeah and I think that's when the seeds of the podcast was so in my think. because we were up to, we missed the last train and we were just with Karaoke with each other and Sydney. And there was like two other people.

- Yeah.

- And then everyone else had fallen asleep but it was just us two and one other guy. It was it like? It was like 5:00 AM.

- I remember who the other guy was? I don't remember either.

- Four guy.

- It wasn't like a friend of Garnt or mine. It was just a dude.

- He didn't know who we were. Like, he didn't know that we were like Anime YouTubers or anything. So we were up at 5:00 AM, drunk shits. And then me and Joey just start hosting this panel for this one guy all right.

- We each had like a Karaoke microphone each like echo you. And we were just like, welcome to the panel. And there's this one dude across the table be like (cheers).

- 'Cause yeah, he didn't know who we were but we still would just hosted this Anime panel for him. I don't know if... I didn't even know him, if he watched anime or not but I'm like Joey, what's your opinion on Bucky Mourner Gutter, who is the best skill?

- That's when all for like an hour

- Yeah and this went on for like an hour then after that, we were like, we need to host a panel together. And we managed to do that last year at AX

- Which was awesome.

- That was amazing.

- Yes.

- Yeah like two, three years in the making and in between that, we were like, surely we gonna make a podcast all the time then.

- And here we are after fucking what? Three or four years.

- Yeah.

- From like first conception. And like, even like planning this whole podcast out as well like took a very, very long time.

- Because this is actually a studio for it.

- Yes so we had to like, get our own studio as you can see, we're still working on it, still working on it, but give us some time, stick around for that.

- It's like getting a studio in Japan

- Oh my God.

- In Tokyo my God don't even get me started on how hard that was like.

- I'm sure we can talk about in future our experiences with just renting stuff in Japan, my God. But yeah now you know, what's funny when you guys are like you said, he like just clicked like that after you guys start talking it's so like, I think that happens easily when you're both like around the same, like sub thing. Cause there's no question if you're trying to leach off each other.

- Right.

- Yeah.

- 'Cause I remember like when I first started and when I was trying like, when we were like first like hanging out, I always felt like, man they wonder if I'm just like a leach or something. Cause like I had like 150, 200 and they had like million plus right. So you just get this thing in your head. You're like, man, am I like leaching? Do they think that? But then like when you get, like I think now I don't give a shit because like I.

- I mean like concerning you and I, when we popped off very naturally because spoiler we never ended up doing that fucking Rap Battle.

- Yeah.

- And that just like disappeared because I think the first time I like publicly did something with you was on your stream.

- Yeah, yeah you did.

- And we played BROFORCE together for like three hours.

- Yeah, it's still up on, on YouTube.

- Really?

- Yeah and then I think we just, I played a lot of games on your stream with you. And then I think we just hang out at AX and you just went and then obviously.

- 'Cause we tie like Metal Slug (mumbles)

- Metal Slugs is like my favorite games. And then I think we just did British things and met up and got, yeah. (mumbling) I feel like it's so easy to befriend other British people 'cause it's just like, we just get it I don't know.

- Not, like going off to what you said about feeling like your leaching from someone.

- Yeah.

- It's weird right because you can, as someone who's been in the position of, you know, not being a smaller YouTuber and in a larger YouTuber, it's you can kind of get a sense just from meeting a plus in this house. Actually if you meet them in real life, right? Online it's so fucking difficult to gauge what a character what someone's character is actually like. And you know, if they're trying to, you know, leach off you get clout or whatever, but especially at a event like AX. (laughs)

- Where the real person comes out.

- Yeah, you can definitely get a better judge of character at a convention or meeting someone in real life, like a big event, like AX.

- I think there's also a lot with that. Is that when you're at AX, I think some people think, okay I've only got five minutes with this guy and I've got to like befriend him.

- Yeah.

- So they, I think they, like sometimes they go overboard with like trying to impress you where it's like, what the fuck is this guy?

- I mean, one thing I've noticed with when it comes to like, 'cause I've been to so many conventions where like people have come up to me just for that like five minutes that they have time with somebody that's an like just, I don't wanna say kiss us but you know, when someone's trying to kiss us or like, but like the thing is that like, at least earlier on when I would meet people like that and they're trying to be nice to me during those five minutes. I didn't know if they were Just trying to kiss my ass or if they would genuinely nice people.

- Yeah.

- But the one way I found it is if they can, I guess like maybe try and maintain that friendship with you and try and stay contact with you after that event. Then I think there like genuinely nice people.

- Yeah, because I don't wanna make it sound like we're all fucking assholes. (laughing) Talking with, hearing about how you just messaged Conner back from just that one email, I also remember the point when I would just try to like talk to everyone and collaborate with everyone. But then you get to a point when you see that 90% of these emails, 90% of these people talking to you don't actually mean what they mean or they're looking for something and you get a sense. You get a sense for that as time goes by. So it's.

- I feel like you can just glance at an email now and you know what they're up to. What I'm trying to get.

- Usually if it starts with I'm 13 years old, (laughing) then that's something (mumbles) to delete.

- Actually here's a question for you. What's the way I know you've got some stories of this Conner.

- I don't.

- What are some of like the weirdest fun emails, you've ever received? (laughing)

- It's like, I get them every week. I like to say every week, but it's like, I've gotten some where it's just like, I genuinely think like I'm actually scared to open it. Even though there's like no attachments, no links or anything, but even a subject title. It's literally just, I open it and it says, "you're cool." (laughing) Opening an email like that at like midnight is like the scariest ever, because I'm just like did my computer just get act. I don't know if this is like an elaborate like chores or if it's just like a 10-year old who's learning to use email for the first time like. I'm like thanks but who are you?

- When they just send a link, that's cool. It's sounds like (laughs)

- No that's all it looks like

- Men I don't know, I've got so many stories, I guess of emails because I guess it's my fault because I kind of encouraged that a little bit.

- Yeah.

- I've made multiple videos where I've got content from my email sometimes it's good but then also I think now since I've joined an agency, I feel bad for the agency where they sometimes see the shit I get said. (laughing) Luckily I normally like delete the ones that I know are like they're just trolling. The full by agency can see it. 'Cause I don't want some Japanese worker opening my email and it being like, "hey, I think you're dummy thick." And I'm 13 by the way. (laughing) You get stuff where they'll say like, they wanna date you and they'll put the 13. And like, it's just like, this is Chris Hansen is Chris Hansen emailing me. I think I've spoken about this in a video once. But there was someone who emailed me and I still remember this. 'cause like I had an interview, I replied to it and it was this interaction where they sent me a script of phone sex that we'll gonna have.

- What?

- So it looked like it was like,

- What?

- I actually still have the script. I'm not gonna read it out because there's more to the story. There's the reason why I decided not make it into a video. But it was like a script and (laughs) first it was one script was me and her and there was also a music setlist that she'd chosen. So that was when the music was playing. (laughing)

- You in the end by Lincoln Park

- It was like pour some sugar on me, you know like the cheesiest song. And so I thought in my head, 'cause back then I read all of them in depth and I thought wow, this is the video idea. If I can like, keep this going.

- And there's also another script where is me having gay sex with Sebastian Michael's.

- Of course

- Of course.

- I mean, that would be expected.

- It's funny that's like not the weirdest story.

- I'm surprised you didn't make a video.

- Wow, okay this why and I feel bad. I hope this person isn't watching. So I interacted with them a bit and they were like obviously I knew they were gonna be strange right. Because you sent an email like that. And I started interacting with them more and more. And then they started sending me way too much information about themselves. There's also another guy who sent me his birth certificate by the way. That's all (mumbles)

- Don't do that. Don't do that.

- That's dangerous.

- I didn't ask for his opening email, was his my birth certificate, driving license, address. And I was like, what? (laughing) I also mentioned this. I don't know which video I said, I mentioned all this, but yeah. So I replied to this person, I kept replying with them 'cause they kept replying with really funny stuff. And I was like, Oh my God, I can get an amazing video out of this. And then, with the one thing they said which made me think, okay now I just have to like completely scrapple this is the day and they said like, "oh here are my hobbies, hobbies, blah, blah, blah by the way, I'm in the Special Olympics Team for the USA." And I was like, "oh my God, what? No, no, no, no, like why you shouldn't be sending this? And then I explained to them, you know, I was like hey, maybe you shouldn't send this email to me. And you know, I don't think this is appropriate way. And I'm very sorry for like messing with your time and stuff. And I just, it was a whole thing where I was like, oh my God, I'm in a asshole. And Jesus Christ like. But yeah there's so many emails I've gotten I mean, I made a whole video where, I went on a date with someone in it was a date.

- Yeah.

- From an email.

- That was scary watching that video.

- You were like Connor's gotta get cancer. (laughing)

- This kid's gonna get stabbed.

- I remember you pitching that video idea to me and I'm just like, Conner I don't know if that's the best idea, but I mean it turned out a good video.

- Yeah I pitched it like 10 of our friends and everyone's like, "wow, wow, wow Conner, Conner no, don't do that, don't do that."

- Whenever I ask my friend was like genuinely worried for you is like, I really don't think. I think Connor's going to die.

- I think if you watch the video, they felt more concerned for the girl because we turned up with light, me, Evan Budan and another guy. I just won't go. Yeah I just said one go alone right. So, like you know, but it also awesome in the end, it was all awesome.

- She really nice about the video. She actually liked the video. So that was good.

- She just walked into a casting couch. I guess like I don't get so about that. Exactly, I can't talk I actually don't get that many weird emails or weird fan mails. I don't know, I guess, it's 'cause I mostly talk about anime and it's less about my own personality, I guess. I don't know, I guess like one weird email I got recently which wasn't even an emailed to me, right. So someone used my email and pretended to be me and emailed STUDIO WIT. (laughing) Okay, I got the email here actually. They emailed STUDIO WIT pretending to be me. 'Cause they use my email and I got a notification from the official studio with like, you know, like the automatic notification that says, "hey you've submitted this email to us." Okay so the email reads. "Hello, I am anime reviewer Gigguk, (Conner laughs) I will make a request of you. Many people once Eren and Mikasa to have a relationship. (laughing) Eren X Mikasa. I think if this happens, many people will enjoy the anime more." (laughing)

- And this has to be a troll.

- "I would be pleased with the development of events in this direction that it was. (laughing) I hope you will evaluates my proposal. I wish you good day."

- Man.

- "I wish you good day." (laughs)

- This sounds like the email I sent contactly for more so we can figure out the logistics.

- We can figure the logistics of Eren X Mikasa. (laughing)

- Oh my God!

- You know, let's just completely bypass this SAR might just go straight to I, feel like.

- They have that the final say.

- We're doing this.

- I like how they just emailed STUDIO WIT who has no creative control over how Attack on Titan is gonna end anyway.

- I really want, I really wish that like STUDIO WIT took that email seriously and like actually hooked up. Like you say, "I'm a being late." So this popular animated review was (laughing)

- You know Gigguk of right?

- "You know Gigg of right, Gigg UK?" If she wants Eren and Mikasa together?. Do you think that's possible?

- Can you make this a thing?

- Can you please make this a thing.

- Hey, season four, Attack on Titan. I'm ready, I'm ready.

- Hey, you never know like none of us have caught up on the manga, right?

- Yeah

- No, no, it might, it might happen.

- I feel like, it's a crime to.

- And if it does happen, we can thank a certain email. (laughing)

- Eren X Mikasa is a thing I know. I know, who calls this. (laughing)

- Jesus Christ.

- I think, I mean To break out this. This is been a long time coming. Welcome to Trash Taste Podcast.

- If you want to know drinking is going to be of quite frequent occurrence on this show. So get used to it.

- Yeah, so that was I didn't imagine our intro is gonna be that long though. In my head I was like. (cheering)

- Finally. I think , would you guys all say that an Attack on Titan season four as your most anticipated.

- Absolutely.

- Absolutely. So how do you even match that hype of this point?

- Wait it's takes?

- It's it was meant to be airing this fall. I think

- No this Summer I believe

- No it was definitely, it was fall.

- Really?

- Yeah

- You've (mumbles) (laughing)

- So I should have gone up against the guy emails to deal with. (laughing)

- Personal contact that way. (laughing)

- But yeah, I think it's, I'm pretty sure it's Eren it was scheduled to a next fall. And I've heard from, because I made a video about the first three seasons of (mumbles) and I've heard from pretty much everyone who's read the manga that season four is going to be the best season.

- No, I have also heard.

- I mean even if it was just mediocre, I feel like it would still like, just think it's amazing. 'Cause I did journey to get there has been sure and this last part was, oh my God.

- Every (mumbles) was as hey

- My God. Like, it's so rare that you get to see a series just improve over time every season. Because I remember when Attack on Titan season one was airing right? And I was, it was great. It was great. But I felt like it was very forgettable in the sense of, well, I remember when season two ads, I didn't remember anything that happened in season one.

- You don't I remember specifically in your video of the like seasonal review, you said, remember the Attack on Titan and then you just play cricket noises. (laughing) And I remember being like well, I'm watching Attack on Titan season two. It's good and I think.

- No I do agree like season two, because season one when I watched it, I was like, okay this. (mumbling) And then season two came around and actually dropped it.

- No one cared drinks.

- Because I think what it was, was that because season one was, you know, all about like the action and just like building the world and then season two was a lot of politics and a lot of talking.

- Yes season two just took the pace 'cause season one was like a fucking roller coaster. You were going up and down every few episodes. It's like, you didn't know what was gonna happen. But to me it felt a bit empty and season two felt much slower paced. There was more of like a slow burn when they focus more on the characters. But I actually got really drawn into the world way more into season two. But by the time season two ended, I was like, okay I'm now way more invested but nothing really big has happened.

- 'Cause it was 12 episodes.

- Yeah, yeah it was just 12 episodes.

- I think everyone was like, what the fuck we've waited four years or something for 12 episodes.

- Because they rushed it out.

- Yeah. But you expected it. I mean, definitely I think in season three when that scene with Levi came out, as I think when it just exploded because everyone saw that GIF on Twitter, it was like I got a fucking catch up like saying like just thinking about that scene, like gives me goosebumps. It's so good.

- It's so good

- Because I remember season three, part one I enjoyed so fucking much. 'Cause I didn't realize I could care about the politics that much in the Attack on Titan 'cause I remember by the time season three started, I was enjoying Attack on Titan for completely different reasons than season one. You know what I mean? I can say the same thing about every season. So I've heard season four is going to be completely different, completely different to what's previously been.

- 'Cause I mean like, I don't remember when it was, but me and Aki went to the Attack on Titan exhibit that they did in Roppongi. And basically it was really tough because what they did was essentially, they really catered to the Manga Reader, unfortunately and I am not the Manga Reader. So in like the late of rooms of this exhibit, they basically like on all the walls, they would have like the original Ganga of the Manga right in these frames, which is fucking cool. But then as he got further down the exhibit, they would start showing stuff that hadn't been adapted yet. So I was like, all right (laughing) Cover my eyes. But obviously there was just some stuff that I couldn't really avoid seeing. And the tiny little bit that I did say out of context, I was like,

- What the fuck?

- Wow, there is no fucking way that's happening. And then to top it off, there was this room. This was like a really experimental move on them, their part but there was this room that you had to go into and it was completely pitch-black room. And there's just audio playing on the speakers in this pitch-black room. And what that audio is, it's audio of what he say I'm envisions the final chapter of the Attack on Titan time to be.

- That's so this you should handled.

- There's no visuals, there's no visuals. It's just audio. And it's what he envisions. It will sound like adapted. The only thing we've heard was a lot of like background noises and like ambient noises and Mikasa yelling Eren from a long way away.

- Okay, that could mean anything (laughs)

- Was could mean anything, I mean like, I'm obviously not doing the audio justice, but sound it epic.

- Can we get a one-to-one reenact (mumbles)

- It was just like (cheering) That's all the well. (Garnt meows)

- Just were screaming in there. (laughing)

- Yeah, but I mean, I'm obviously not doing the audit just as but it sounded like when I just like close my eyes and heard that I was like, wow I've never been more excited for anime in my life.

- It's good to know that the anime and the Manga will end with Mikasa screaming Eren and she has that.

- Technically a spoiler.

- She has done for the entire fucking series. (laughing)

- I mean with the track record the Attack on Titan has right now. I mean it's, every episode you could argue has been really good, right? I mean this story has just been, there's no faults in the story so far, right. It holding up pretty well.

- Yeah, I say it had been building on his story.

- Right really well

- Really, really well.

- Like what if this, if they nail this ending, what like category is this end-of-life?

- Master piece.

- What would you put it as like in like anime in the same category then if it killed this last season?

- My fucking God!

- Like 'cause couldn't even be in its own thing where like no anime is like as good?

- I would say

- It's hot.

- That's not to say, that's a big statement right there.

- But I mean, I'm just trying to think how many, how many anime series have there been where it's stretched out for, I mean

- Over 50 episodes

- Over 50 episodes, like let's say four or five seasons and has like killed at this hard.

- Yeah I would say it be similar to something like Fullmetal Alchemist, Hunter Hunter. Although I'd say it's, I haven't seen Fullmetal Alchemist. I get that's. (laughing) (Joey screaming) My fan base, my fan base knows this. This is a big fucking Meme but Fullmetal Alchemist is that one anime that I haven't seen. We all have that one anime.

- I guess when I think about you know, Hunter Hunter for it's, I mean, it hasn't ended though, which is probably the one where you couldn't argue it's in the same class but I guess from a Locus Brotherhood, maybe you could.

- Yeah, because you never know like Hunter Hunter might, I'm hoping God, but you never know but Hunter Hunter, might end up like Yu Yu Hakusho.

- I think that's the problem that I think everyone's kind of beginning to accept that slowly because the world is just especially now with the dark continent stuff, which, you know it's a lot of stuff in Hunter Hunter but it's looking like it's even more ambitious than before and he's not releasing chapters at a very slow, right.

- It's gonna take a whole lifetime to catch up but going back to Attack on Titan, I think I called it like, if it's even if it was of the quality of season three part two ended in that quality, it would be a modern classic.

- Oh, for sure?

- Yeah, if it's even better than that, I have no fucking clue but that makes me so excited.

- So we might be getting the...

- The fact that there's a possibility of that.

- Yeah.

- It's just nuts.

- I think the last time I was possibly that excited for like a followup was One-Punch Man season two.

- We all know how that.

- I'm like it wasn't okay I rewatched a few clips recently of One-Punch Man season two. I know like it wasn't that bad. I think it's just, we set our expectations disgusting we have.

- It wasn't bad. It was painfully mediocre.

- It's like Seven Deadly Sins season one. And then it like. So what I'm hoping, what I'm hoping is the next season, assuming we get another one of One-Punch Man is it doesn't go to sleep. (laughing loudly)

- Oh my God. That shit is still like, I haven't seen any of Seven Deadly Sins. I don't know anything about it. Never had the manga and never watched the anime, but not gonna lie, there's a part of me when I saw footage of season three. I was like, I kind of wanna watch this now Just to see it devolve into this current state.

- Like I remember because the fight that they fucked up, was one of the most collective sites.

- In the manga, right the survival.

- Yeah he was one of the most hyped fights And then they fought it up so much that fan animation of that fight that was released before, looked better than the official fights.

- Because when I found out about that scene is someone put it up on Twitter and had to preface it by saying, no this is not a fun animation. This is the official episode. Because everybody in that tweet was like, is this fun made? This has to be fun made This is like some guy who like just learn how to use flash like a week ago.

- Just, you know what sticks out in my mind that kick, the kick. (laughing) When that give first came out and I saw the kick which you probably see him on screen right now. I lost it.

- Oh my God, I laughed so hard.

- I don't think I'd ever, like, I've watched all of Seven Deadly Sins up until that point. And like, I wasn't like a huge fun, but we bought every time a new season was announced to be of UVA's I'd watched them.

- Yeah.

- I'd never so quickly lost interest in a series just from seeing that one screenshot. Melitis like getting the bed. I was like, what did they do to him? What did they do to him? (laughing) We've never seen anything like is that happen anime before like where a season is like so drastically like changed studios and lost.

- I'm sure like if you take.

- I know there have been, and I know I'm going to kill myself for not remembering like what this is but there's been so many times that's.

- That drastic though.

- Yeah.

- It has been a few months

- May be because the difference was is when it happened back then is that there wasn't Twitter. And when it happens now or you know, when it happens now.

- Yeah exactly, there was just like a bunch of light we'll talk, gathering, being linked, (mumbles)

- Like the only thing I can think of right now, is like off the top of my head is Bizarre. Which I mean, it's changed studio but it was technically a continuation.

- Okay, what's worse than Bizarre The second adaptation of Bizarre or the Seven Deadly Sins the new seasons.

- Bizarre.

- Really.

- It might say Bizarre, yeah.

- Okay.

- Because I mean, like, you know, I'm seeing that from like a hardcore Bizarre fan.

- I haven't heard the Mangas so.

- Yeah so if he goes, if you've read the manga and I'm sure everybody who's read the Manga can agree with this but I have never wanted to like cry from sadness. (laughing) I'm like, how could they do my boy guards like that? And I'm like, yeah, this is. Because the Bizarre adaptation was just a failure on pretty much

- Every level

- Every level from like the animation which everyone likes to point out. But like the composition, the sound design. I mean, if you've heard, if you heard that like (body parts breaking) Like sound, it's just, what how did you get this? Who did you hire to do the sound artists?

- Fucking came up with that sound

- Like, how did you see this big fucking iron sword? And just like,

- Let's pull it out the Cal Bell. (laughing)

- Just do Jojo Make everything a gunshot.

- I mean gun would been even better honestly.

- Can I talk about Jojo sound design? I love Jojo sound design so much because sound design is something that people don't normally talk about. And you don't, you don't really, you don't really hear people

- It's like voice (mumbles) right. When it's done well, you don't notice.

- Yeah, so with Jojo sound design, it's one of the few shows where if you hear like a sound,

- You know is from Jojo.

- You know the exact stance and you know, like sometimes it's the exact episode and the exact fights because they're that recognized when that they're like not generic at all. And I fucking love Jojo sound design because the reason why I think the anime is as good as it is, one of the reasons is that the sound design is so good. Like, have you guys seen the I assume you guys have seen the Jojo OPs where they add the sound effects.

- And it's so much better, isn't it?

- So cool. I don't know why they didn't do that for the Eren versions.

- I mean, it's not really what you see in an OPs.

- It is pretty unconventional

- But I mean, there's so many sounds that you could say, like I call it, like, when you hear that gunshot for the punch, you know what the Jojo punch.

- Yeah, yeah. And it makes it sound so meaty. It's great.

- Oh, I love that

- That's the punching sound is like every time, you know like there's like a mood or like or an oral or on like, the, it is almost like gun like, isn't it

- I'm pretty sure it's like gunshot here. It's a gunshot. And then obviously there's a Waldo timestamp. (light strikes) Which I feel like has almost become the universal sound of stopping time.

- Yeah, exactly. (laughing) And then there's also the you know, I mean if you talk about music alone, my God, of the new season absolutely killed it.

- Oh my God, yeah.

- It's like, I think super, a part of Giorno said this in his review of Golden Wind and I feel the same way. Like this is Golden Wind was the first adaptation of a Jojo where I think the anime is better because you lose so much when you take away that sound right and especially the music. When you hear that Giorno's Theme come on.

- Giorno's Theme is one of the few tracks in anime that has been means to death.

- Yeah it is Al megalomania.

- And I have not gotten bored of it all

- Every like every version of heard of Giorno's Theme have the equally, just be like yes. (laughing) It's so like a piano version, middle version, I don't care. It's always been so good.

- Yeah go on so on.

- When we can go back to the gym, some of the best music to put when you're working out is Jojo's. It works so well. And I know it should work well, but man when that piano hits, you're doing an extra rep, no matter how tired you are, you're doing that extra rep.

- Yeah it's so good.

- It's almost too hype sometimes you are like a shit I got to keep doing this rapper. I'm dying right now. I don't know where my boy, Jojo down.

- Speaking of anime adaptations though, there is one topic I would like to cover because it is quite timely. But just yesterday I actually recording over as of us recording this episode, I found or I I guess AKI found that somebody is adapting, Killing Stalking.

- You mean it's not an official

- This needs the biggest quote marks ever adapting

- "Adapting" Killing Stalking "Anime."

- You there is no an official animate adaptation like everyone on Twitter thinks it is.

- Okay.

- It was like pop most the original Twitter post that blew this up said an official adaptation. And then in the reply to that tweet, they doubled down saying it. "Yeah, it was all official." But the thing that caught my eye is the picture that everyone was re-tweeting right. Three pictures of this tweet. One of them, it was like chAosOPUS STUDIO. The fuck it's a chAosOPUS STUDIO

- Yeah so like, 'cause AKI found that on a timeline and was like Holy shit they're making us Killing Stalking anime adaptation. I'm like, really let me see. And I saw the pictures on like the first two and it was like coming soon, 2020. I was like, oh shit okay. And then I looked at the last one and it was like chAosOPUS STUDIO? I'm like,

- Yeah, yeah right.

- Who? (laughing) What is the Studio? I legitimately had to look it up on Wikipedia being like maybe it's just one of them. 'Cause you know, recently there've been so many fucking Japanese anime studio guys come out with like ridiculous names. I'm like, probably it's just one of those.

- Exactly.

- I looked it up and I'm like, Nope, it's literally just one dude. (laughs) It's a one dude.

- I feel bad for whoever's making this 'cause like my God they wanna hype, they just got thrusted on them. And everyone's assuming this is like legit.

- I mean, how did the hype just happen? Did they just

- There is literally just the tweet.

- Just the tweet.

- Yeah, the original Twitter I think has all of us recording, I think it has like 40,000 likes and like 20,000 retweets or something that.

- Wow.

- Because Killing Stalking fans are flawless. They are ruthlessly dedicated.

- And then I saw, the thing was this one in the lower in the replies to that people weren't questioning whether like it was legit. People were just questioning. Should it get an adaptation? And that was the main argument. I think that's why it was getting so many reasons.

- Should you guys think he should get an adaptation? I mean, let me change the question. Have you guys read it?

- I've read the first like story. What is it like it came out and like stories, right?

- It's like seasons.

- Yeah I watched, I read the first season and I quite liked it and you know, it's a lot but I feel like from what I've heard as well that handles it quite well towards the end.

- Yeah I did a video on it. I actually looked back on when I did my video of it was four years ago.

- Holy shit. Was it that long ago?

- Yeah

- I remember you released that like yesterday

- I thought was like maybe like a year or two ago

- Yeah

- Was four years ago. And that's because I only reviewed the first season because I think the series ended like I think it was like last year.

- Yeah.

- Yeah

- But it was like a huge gap right. So I've only really seen or read like the first half of it. And it was, you know, it was marketed as like, it's a really hard call, like gruesome yellowish. So you know, all these fan girls getting on it. And I was like, okay, I mean, I don't know if I'm gonna enjoy it as much because I'm not exactly the target demographic but I'll give it a go. And it was like a genuinely good story. Like yeah it had yellow elements in it, but you know, I'm an adult, I can handle that. So other than, if you take away the yellow elements, it's just a really, really good horror mystery. But when I sold that they were gonna make a quote "anime adaptation for it." I was like, I don't know because immediately what I thought of is all of these other like over-sexualized series getting anime adaptations recently

- Cause as someone who hasn't read, it seems like it's a very sexual story that would have to be heavily sensitive.

- It is hardcore

- Is one of, I think it will say it has such a like it's divided a lot of community. 'Cause I think a lot of people really sexualize it when it's just a really fucked up dynamic and a lot of, I mean a lot of really deep shit of like possessiveness and all that. But if you've thinking about reading it, it's a lot like it's

- Going into with caution definitely.

- Definitely be over the age of 18.

- We have to legally say that. (laughing loudly)

- I think you should read it but then also like I can totally recommend you not to read it like it's your life would be totally fine if you don't read it.

- May be I'll watch the anime instead in my opinion they're.

- Talking about the anime, like I said, I feel bad for this person. 'Cause a lot of people are putting a lot of hype on it. But also what I saw, it's a one man job like this guy's doing everything. And I don't know if it's a guy or a girl but they seem to be in charge of, they seem to be 3D modelers. I think that's what that trade is. And I saw the voice acting Casting Call and as someone who's, you know, done a lot of voice acting Casting Calls, I've made my own, I've worked with a lot of professional ones like it is not normal. I had to say, I don't wanna be mean to them 'cause I don't think that like that experience. And I think other voice actors are helping them with it. But first of all, normally you don't name who's gotten what role publicly. Right so on the Casting Call Document which I think we've maybe show on screen for a second. It says like one person who has the role and it's showing publicly, that's not normally the case. Normally it's just here with the lines, auditioned for it. And the way it's laid out is really old. And it's just over, I mean, over Twitter, isn't that weird but there's no mention of pay or anything. Like I guess, I mean, it is a fan made project but normally, still you say if it's paid or not.

- Yeah.

- You normally say how, you know, how many lines they're gonna be. It just, I don't know. It looks like it belongs on like Casting Call Club which is an amateur voice hunting website.

- Yeah.

- Which makes me uneasy because if it is gonna be a USB microphone kind of deal, it's not can sound good 'cause there was no, here's the minimum the requirements for you to sanitary room, there was nothing. It was just, if you wanna audition. And I saw the replies to this thread and it was like all 13-year old sounding girls auditioning. (laughing)

- Yeah but that's because the main like readership all of Killing Stalking our 13 year old girls, even though it shouldn't be from purely based on context, it should not be.

- It's just worrying with these kinds of things as well 'cause normally like when I've done plus 18 projects, I normally ask for proof of ID when they if I cast someone like they need to show me their ID and this should definitely be one of those situations where I like those precautions should be taken even if it's fan made right. Like, yeah, not good look for you if you're getting 13-old girls to voice in your thing about like, you know some pretty fun shit.

- I mean it's still very early days, I mean from what it sounds like, it's sounds like a situation where someone just

- way too much press.

- Got way too much press, way too quickly because I have no doubt that they probably have no fucking experience.

- Because I saw it on the Twitter actually just this morning. Yeah they tweeted out being like, oh my God after someone retweeted my thing, I've gained like 10,000 Twitter followers in like overnight. And like, you know, this person obviously like came from like pretty much close to zero followers. So for them that's a lot.

- Yeah.

- That's a lot of like pressure just immediately built up on them because you're going after such like, I don't want to say iconic but like a very, like very, very dedicated series.

- I think it's not just that as well. Cause I think what really built up the hype as well as we're in like this environment now where Webtoons animated.

- They could be.

- Are being major so you wouldn't be, it wouldn't have been surprising to say Killing Stalking is getting an anime as opposed to like last year even two years ago where, you know we didn't have any precedents for that but now we've Tower of God airing and a God of High School and Noblesse all getting anime. It's like maybe we're in a new era where people are expecting that their favorite Webtoons or their favorite webcomics for whatever country could get anime adaptations.

- Yeah sure, sure.

- I mean to be fired, I wouldn't be against the idea of actually getting an official adaptation.

- Or Killing Stalking?

- Yeah I think it could be definitely make waves.

- I mean it would make sense considering that recently there's been like a big trend of like, as I said earlier, like over-sexualized series like we've got a Shu Matson airing getting

- Yeah my fucking God, how they gonna handle it?

- How are they gonna handle that? Because there is legitimately a sex scene every three pages. Like I'm not even kidding.

- So I don't know anything about this monograph. So wait, what is it called?

- It's called Shu Matson Harold.

- Or Wild Hentai

- And basically the overall plum oversimplifying this but basically.

- It's a handclap flawed.

- Humanity has gone to shit, where there was a disease that is killing all males. It's already affecting males. So basically now

- You can tell (laughing)

- It's a hentai plot. It's a hentai plot. So basically males now are becoming like a commodity they're basically being treated like males that have like survived this disease.

- Yeah.

- Basically like treated as like national defenses.

- Let me just wait, first of all the difference between this hentai, right? Is that if it was a hentai, it'd be an ugly bastard.

- Yeah.

- It's like a handsome young guy.

- It's like several handsome young guys.

- Okay that's how it happened. It's an ugly bastard. It's a hentai (Garnt laughs)

- But like the dynamic it could see, this is where a difference from a hentai though is that our main character has like this girl that he's been thinking about his whole life. And basically like, doesn't wanna just go around and like just scrap their sex everyone in order to save him he'd rather keep his like purity for the goal that he needs to be thinking of.

- So it's about waiting for the right person.

- It's basically blue balls, the manga. Because everyone else all five other guys having a fucking great time. They're fucking different chicks every day.

- They're pretty much, they're pretty much like what hentai of protagonist should be

- I'm not being sold on this, but saying that I wasn't sold to Interspecies Reviewers until I watched it. This is pretty funny.

- It's not gonna be as good.

- Oh no.

- Interspecies Reviewers is like a really weird case because it was something that was definitely, definitely itchy in the manga, in the manga in the anime. They just made it porn. But I still like, I still, I don't know Interspecies Reviewers to me is that line between hentai and (mumbles) because you don't watch Interspecies Reviewers to jack off right. But it's undeniable that there is just a straight up sex scene in it.

- Which is really interesting though because the one sex scene that everyone was raving on about in the anime, I think it was episode four,

- Three

- Three Episode three was never in the Manga.

- No, it wasn't.

- It was implied all sex scenes of the series is implied in the Manga. But in the anime that was just like fucking let's just show it, like.

- Put things into perspective. You didn't even see nipple in the Manga. That was like,

- That's a lie.

- You did it.

- Yeah, you didn't see nipple. I know I own all the volumes. (laughing)

- You seen this man's Twitter. He knows a nipple when he sees.

- I all know the volumes And I've enjoyed every single one.

- Can we talk about your Twitter in a bit? Can we please talk legit? Because it would make me play

- By the way follow me on Twitter guys that the anime with a wrong clip. (laughing)

- Can you please explain your Twitter?

- What's meanings explain my Twitter.

- First of all, whenever I go on Twitter, right? I don't follow Hentai artists on Twitter because I don't need to because this man's got me COVID because I actually know on Twitter. When you, like a picture, there's a good chance for some reason, especially Joey's specifically it comes on my Twitter and I must get at least every time I open Twitter, six or seven, like either like follow on sex things or like very, very loose. It's always Joey. It's like, I'm like I don't follow porn like Joey Bissinger and it's like how does she get to this point?

- Okay here's what I don't understand, right? Like how many people do you follow on Twitter? Like on average

- I think I have 600 something.

- Okay 600

- Above them I mean

- Okay, right you both follow about over 500 people.

- Yeah.

- And like this isn't just YouTube like I've had this from like mutual friends of mine.

- Everyone says, it's you.

- How is it that my likes end up on everybody's timeline? Like, am I only like Twitter preferred?

- I have no fucking clue, but it is, I would say 70 to 80% of the time I see Ludes on my timeline, it is you. It is trade-off

- First of all, you're welcome. (laughing)

- Okay 'cause this thing used to be the case. And like, I swear, you were way more timid about it. How did, 'cause I'm scared of doing that. I don't know 'cause I mean, I shouldn't really, 'cause there basically half naked into my videos, but I don't know I was getting, I was just worried about like, she just having porn on my thing, but now I guess I can get away with it. How did you go from not sharing porn to basically just

- To being the Hentai.

- I've always shared it, that's the thing.

- Have you? I swear you didn't.

- I mean maybe not only.

- No, no, no

- This one now you're seeking.

- I think it was just Twitter changing the like button to be basically the retweet

- That's a pretty much. That's exactly what it is. Because for the entirety that I've been on Twitter I've liked hentai because I followed hentai like people like hentai out side like Titan I've discovered, but I've never retweeted it because of this exact reason. I don't want other people's timelines to be filled with hentai. But Twitter was just like, hey, let's just like, make the like button, like a better retweet button.

- I gonna ask how much of your feed is Just had?

- That's why I asked, I asked to see his phone.

- Do you wanna see it now? It wasn't that bad when I first saw it,.

- I mean, the thing is I don't follow that many hentai artists. I know that's hard to believe, but I genuinely don't, the thing is I follow a hentai artists that love retweeting other hentai artists. And that's where I find all the people. Okay, here.

- Scroll, scroll through it.

- You want scroll down my Twitter.

- Let's see.

- Let's see how many come up?

- There one, one and three.

- Can you also like everyone that opinions. (laughing)

- You go to his likes from when this is

- Go to my likes, go to my likes.

- Hope that's another one?

- That's two in a row.

- Oh, wait that's a Jimmy Neutron there. That's my mentor. (laughing)

- Oh my phone. Okay, let me, while they're looking through the Twitter, let me defend myself real quick, okay. The reason why I like it's because at the end of the day, these are just drawings, right? There's a difference between liking like actual human porn versus just a picture.

- This man is about to go the hentai. (laughs)

- I am genuinely one of those people who looks at hentai as odd.

- I totally agree with you. (Conner laughs) Shut up, fuck.

- I'm sorry.

- I'm talking on behalf of every hentai lover watching this episode, including you

- I love hentai. I just I don't know if I look at it and be unlike, just crack open a beer and just enjoy.

- The boy, no, no, no. I've gotten to that point, right? I've gotten to the point of you seeing fucking room, you see my fucking office, which is just like full of like anime thighs and stuff like that. Because it's gotten to the point where sometimes you just see this like drawing of a girl or a thigh or something. And I just don't even get horny anymore. I'm just like, I'm fucking impressed at how good they make.

- That was me when I saw them (mumbles) in Seven Deadly Sins.(Garnt laughs)

- Because they're genuinely like some hentai artists that I've seen. And I know of where I'm just like, if you made an all ages manga, you would sell like crazy.

- Oh no and people have.

- And people have like look at like (mumbles) who made fucking easy on Nathan Novato song.

- Yeah, yeah I love that. (laughing)

- I know, you know put up a picture of it. But okay everyone has seen this chick before, all right. Nano she was originally like a hardcore lowly hentai artist. And he made a really fucking six for all ages, comedy Manga which is hilarious.

- Yeah.

- And like and even if they don't make all, they just stuff, look at artists like Nambata who is like genuinely an amazing artist. And that's what I will like, because you know, we've gotten to this point where hentai has just become like ha ha anime, boobs, hilarious and horny on me. Like it's all just become like a joke thing. I don't want that anymore.

- I don't want that.

- I'm sick of those jokes.

- I want to save this topic because I want. I want this to be a whole episode.

- I'm ready. I want to dedicate a whole episode.

- I'm ready. I have too many things to say about hentai artists that I can't fit all like five minutes.

- Smashed like on this episode, if you want hentai episode because we're gonna do it either way.

- We're gonna do it any way.

- To give this guy is like three sips of beer and they start talking about hentai.

- I shouldn't had a strong (laughing) This is strong.

- I just, I don't know like when I watch hentai, it's like it's for a service, you know? I guess I do it to do, I do the deed, right? Like I don't sit there and like swallow my wine glass and things.

- Am I weird? Am I okay? I wanna know.

- Yeah this is probably the answer to

- Am I weird to be like sometimes I kinda just wanna watch Hentai just doing this.

- Yes that's totally.

- (laughs) That's fucking weird. Come on he's probably going through that phase right now.

- No, no I don't, hentai to me hasn't got to that point. The Doujinshi and manga. Has definitely go into that

- Let's see if this (mumbles).

- There is no part of me in a porn while I like, I watch a porn and I don't immediately skip two minutes then.

- You are the degenerates here, motherfucking.

- I bought a lot Doujinshi from my artists I like, I don't think I've actually read like physical copies of and like hijacked off to it. I know that's TMI I'm sorry,

- I will recommend you some share.

- Okay.

- I do.

- I'll come on and see in Twitter likes and in like four episodes. I'll come back on and be like totally agree with everything. Everything these guys say. I don't know I just.

- Also like, you'll like progression from like, what the fuck to like, you know what? I love this artist.

- Because it's, if you've read enough Doujinshi and you've, if you've read enough like H manga, there are so many the Doujinshi that just have really, really good plots.

- I agree.

- It's this.

- (mumbles) sphere Yeah I do agree. I must say. (laughing)

- It's gotten to this point where sometimes you just want the series to be adapted into hentai I just so you can see an animated and sometimes you read the series that just do something new with porn or hentai that you just have never seen before. And you're like, wow, this is like awakening something in me right now. This is amazing. (laughing)

- Seriously.

- I've never heard someone describe, I've watched hentai and awakened something in him.

- How Levi you know.

- There was some Doujinshi (mumbles) like at first I was like, okay, I dig this art. And then I see like the ECI scenes and I'm like, okay, I'm digging this. Like, you know me, I have like a quarter child. But then as the story continues, I'm like, you know what? Fuck the HTC.

- (mumbles) of the podcast to the wrong boys.

- That question to you a question to all of you watching. Why do you think thigh highs are sexy? And if the answer isn't anime and anime awakened your love for fire highs, you're fucking.

- No I did I mean,

- Because let's be real Japanese girls don't have thighs.

- Yeah, that's true.

- Yeah, so like, if you just think, if you fire thighs is like entry level right in the world of the Doujinshi and H manga that's like some normie shit man. (laughing loudly) They've gotten to that point with enormous fuck.

- Maybe in future, we can return to this topic when I've you know done my research.

- Will come back. We're gonna come back to it, don't worry, don't worry.

- So we're getting ahead of ourselves right now. Okay like this,

- That's an understatement.

- This was meant to be an introductory episode when we introduced whatever, well we're gonna be doing.

- If don't like these topics, I'm sorry. (laughing)

- Always be hentai by the way. Can I just preface that? I just, but I think, I mean, the main reason we started this as well, because we always hang out together. Like it's not one of those things like some YouTube is hangout. They make videos. It seems like they're friendships great, we all actually hang out together all the fucking time. And we always talk for like two hours

- What we're looking at it's essentially what we do on a daily.

- Yeah like, we easily have conversations where we just talk for like three hours about manga an anime.

- Not even about manga anime I remember the last time we were at your house and we talked about like, what was the best book you joined? (laughing) Do you remember that. We like legitimately like hardcore arguing about like easy in-and-out overrated or not for like

- It's not by the way.

- It is.

- Okay we're not gonna get into that. But I suppose, I guess that's, we're gonna be talking about like anything and it's gonna evolve over the time. I mean the core of this anime and manga

- I mean, I have a lot of things about anime and manga that I wanna talk about, but I also want to talk about the culture, the community, hentai, more hentai I guess.

- Yeah and I mean,

- I'm for this.

- Also like just general 'cause we're YouTubers is we wanna talk about sometimes if there's YouTube drama that we feel like we can probably add something to it like of course.

- You know, sometimes if there's just like standard banter of just like, whatever the fuck then, will talk.

- And if any of our mutuals are ever in Japan, like if you wanna talk anime manga with us hit us up.

- Yeah, absolutely. And not even just our mutuals, like if you're just if you don't wanna like come onto the show and like talk, first of all you gotta come on to the show, physically sit right here next to me and talk about it.

- Because we wanna ideally this will be a full person podcast. And hopefully, I mean I'd be really interested in to bring YouTube is on who, don't really get to talk about anime.

- Yeah

- Absolutely.

- And I just hear that side.

- Yeah I mean if there were any YouTube is watching this video or you know, the Twitter or whatever, then I guess let us know if you'd like to come onto the podcast. 'Cause we will happily welcome come on.

- Because it's surprising I've met so many YouTubers who have nothing to do with anime or anything.

- Who watch anime.

- Who watch anime and just really wanna talk about anime to somewhere. And I think it's pretty awesome because I remember anime was nowhere near this popular before. And I remember the feeling of being the only anime fan and have having nothing. I have no one to talk about.

- I mean I think that's why I started my YouTube channel. But that was like my reasoning is that I had no one to talk to this about.

- Let's just say like kids today, have it fucking easy. If you're an anime fan like today, you know, High School, you have it so much easier than any of busted.

- My God, I wish I'm so jealous because I wish I could have just talked to my fucking friends about Narrow Toe or Bleach or One Piece or something.

- I had to convince my friends to get into anime in order for them in order to find someone about anime.

- See, this is like another thing that I, when I talked to Americans, they don't have this problem, at least in my age group. (mumbles) It's like we had Americans had a good but British people and I think probably Australian people are more closer to British like fucking ruthless school. Oh yeah.

- No, definitely.

- And I remember I got shiffer gaming too much at school. So am I other fuck my gonna.

- I mean at that.

- I go shiffer gaming too much in school. So am I gonna sit there and be like, all right. So call of duty, that thing that you play but give me shit for, how about you check out these animated, he's right. Like how do I, I built up years getting to like a medium level of like in between a level of popularity. I was never popular, but I got out of the bullying zone if you will. Didn't wanna go back to that.

- It's really crazy just how like, I don't want to say mainstream animes.

- It's not mainstream.

- It's not mainstream at all, but like I guess just how much more accepted it's become as a subculture.

- It's get enough.

- It's definitely, definitely is because I feel like anime works so well with Meme culture.

- Oh my,

- You know what I mean? An anime in a sense is Meme culture in a lot of ways, I mean

- Flying a room when you mentioned Meme culture and anime (laughing) You all know what we're talking about.

- But I feel like because of that, it's a lot more people know what anime is or at least have seen a Meme or a screenshot or a gift of probably Jojo.

- This is usually where they start.

- That's usually will happen.

- And as it should be,

- It's the only enemy that matters.

- And then people would just recognize that a lot more. Cause I remember when I was growing up, people didn't even know what anime was, the word anime they're like, what the fuck is this? That's some cartoon porn, you know what I mean?

- Yeah, absolutely.

- It's weird 'cause I think one of the biggest like double-edged swords to anime has been Netflix, like in the sense that like it's got a lot of people into anime.

- Yeah

- But then when you get really into anime, it becomes like the fucking (mumbles).

- I mean are we definitely gonna talk about light,

- True that more future. But I think Netflix is also helped a lot 'cause I mean, they've been pushing like I remember like when they started getting anime like Death and it would not get off my fucking recommended on Netflix

- Really?

- Yeah, yeah. And like Fullmetal lockers brother had I think they have that. I think they have all the classics which is pretty impressive.

- Yeah.

- Yeah.

- I mean they have all the entry level most for me to

- Need to watch. Now they have Evangelion as well.

- Yeah exactly

- Which is

- Crazy they call that

- That's just, I can't imagine how much money Netflix through no, be like, hey, can we grab your series that has been pretty much out of print for like 20 plus years.

- I wanna hear the story about how they got that because people have tried for decades, literally decades to get the often ADV died to get the licensing over to the West. So there must be.

- I remember when I

- Lots and lots of money.

- I wrote whatever that use it badly. I actually couldn't believe it. I was like, this is like one of the biggest achievements because it is like, like, you know, without you know wrapping it up in a package nicely like Evangelion is one of the biggest anime like ever made and like I know we all know I know is like hardcore when it comes to protecting it's IP.

- Oh my God!

- Cause I remember for the longest time Hollywood wanted to make that Evangelion adaptation and unknown was just like, fuck off fame.

- Like he did a solid, he does this.

- There are so many live action adaptations being made right now. I couldn't keep track of them all. I remember when there was just one and everyone would just wait a shit on that one. But I think there's like over 10 adaptations being made right now.

- We need to do an episode or we do like a Tier List of the worst Netflix adaptations

- We need to do a Tier List of the fly back.

- Oh God yeah.

- So anyways guys look forward to all of that stuff.

- This was just a taster. We didn't really plan much of what we were gonna say.

- As you can see, we're just talking out of our.

- We were just talking about there wasn't a topic planned and we just kind of evolved (laughs)

- The only talk we talked about was Killing Stalking, which last five minutes. (laughing)

- There we a lot more structure in future when we get a bit more used to it as well. Let me have more topics to talk about but because right now, we'll do wanna cover. I think it would make it really interesting video you hear our opinions pretty early on about things that are like evolving situations.

- And also, if you wanna hear anything or if you wanna request anything that you want to hear us talk about, you can tweet at us

- @TrashTastePod. Go onto Twitter and give us your suggestions. If you guys would also like to ask like any questions like Q and A and stuff like that

- We'll probably have a Q and A section

- And then we'll probably grab some questions over Twitter as well. Basically, if you like to interact with us in any way for future episodes, then definitely follow us on Twitter.

- Yeah

- And also, yeah, just subscribe.(laughs) I don't wanna be that guy to be like, subscribe, like video. (mumbling) But if you do, then that would greatly help us out and be greatly appreciate it.

- As you can see where it's still in like, I'd say like Beta, the Beta Stage of this podcast.

- Yeah. We're gonna be filling up the background and everything done.

- I'm sorry about that. If you found this episode and enjoyed it before we've even pushed it on our main channel, thank you. That's pretty

- Thank you rarely appreciate the guys.

- Yeah I think that's a good place to end it for now.

- Yeah we're gonna be uploading at least one a week and we have a highlight channel as well coming out. So yeah, you can expect at least one of this week .

- Yeah, but look forward to that guys. Thanks for watching. I've been Joey.
